navy he directed the original development of naval nuclear propulsion and controlled its operations for three decades as director of naval reactors in addition he oversaw the development of the shippingport atomic power station the world s first commercial pressurized water reactor used for generating electricity known as the father of the nuclear navy rickover s profound effects on the navy and its most powerful warships were of such scope that he may well go down in history as one of the navy s most important officers he served in a flag rank for nearly 30 years 1953 to 1982 ending his career as a four star admiral his total of 63 years of active duty service made rickover the longest serving naval officer and the longest serving member of the us armed forces in history rickover is only one of four people who have ever been awarded two congressional gold medals his substantial legacy of technical achievements includes the united states navy s continuing record of zero reactor

rickover a polish jewish family from przasnysz in russian poland his parents later changed his name to hyman which like chaim is derived from chayyim meaning life he did not use his middle name godalia a form of gedaliah but when required to list one for the naval academy oath he substituted george rickover made passage to new york city with his mother and sister in march 1906 fleeing antisemitic russian pogroms during the revolution of 1905 and joining abraham who had made earlier initial trips there beginning in 1897 to become established rickover s immediate family lived initially on the east side of manhattan and moved two years later to the north lawndale neighborhood in chicago which at that time was a heavily jewish neighborhood where rickover s father continued work as a tailor rickover took his first paid job at nine years of age earning three cents an hour for holding a light as his neighbor operated a machine later he delivered groceries he graduated from grammar school at 14 while attending john marshall high school in chicago from which he graduated with honors in 1918 rickover held a full time job as a telegraph boy delivering western union telegrams through which he became acquainted with us congressman adolph j sabath himself a czech jewish immigrant through the intervention of a family friend sabath nominated rickover for appointment to the united states naval academy rickover was only a third alternate for appointment but through disciplined self directed study and good fortune rickover passed the entrance exam and was accepted early naval career through world war ii edit rickover s active duty naval career began in 1918 during a time when attending military academies was considered active duty service due in part to world war i on 2 june 1922 rickover graduated 107th out of 540 midshipmen and was commissioned as an ensign he joined the destroyer la vallette on 5 september 1922 rickover impressed his commanding officer with his hard work and efficiency and was made engineer officer on 21 june 1923 becoming the youngest such officer in the squadron he next served on board the battleship nevada before earning a master of science ms in electrical engineering from columbia university in 1930 by way of a year at the naval postgraduate school and further coursework at columbia at the latter institution he met ruth d masters a graduate student in international law whom he married in 1931 after she returned from her doctoral studies at the sorbonne in paris shortly after marrying rickover wrote to his parents of his decision to become an episcopalian remaining so for the remainder of his life rickover had a high regard for the quality of the education he received at columbia as demonstrated in this excerpt from a speech he gave at the university some 52 years after attending in 1929 i attended the columbia school of engineering for postgraduate study in electrical engineering columbia was the first institution that encouraged me to think rather than memorize my teachers were notable in that many had gained practical engineering experience outside the university and were able to share their experience with their students i am grateful among others to professors morecroft hehre and arendt much of what i have subsequently learned and accomplished in engineering is based on the solid foundation of principles i learned from them rickover preferred life on smaller ships and he also knew that young officers in the submarine service were advancing quickly so he went to washington and volunteered for submarine duty his application was turned down due to his age at that time 29 years fortunately for rickover he ran into his former commanding officer from nevada while leaving the building who interceded successfully on his behalf from 1929 to 1933 rickover qualified for submarine duty and command aboard the submarines s 9 and s 48 while at the office of the inspector of naval material in philadelphia pennsylvania in 1933 rickover translated das unterseeboot the submarine by world war i german imperial navy admiral hermann bauer rickover s translation became a basic text for the us submarine service on 17 july 1937 he reported aboard the minesweeper finch at tsingtao china and took command the future longest serving us navy officer assumed his only ship command with additional duty as commander mine division three asiatic fleet the marco polo bridge incident had occurred ten days earlier and in august finch stood out for shanghai to protect american citizens and interests from the conflict between chinese and japanese forces on 25 september rickover was promoted to lieutenant commander retroactive to 1 july in october his designation as an engineering duty officer became effective and he was relieved of his three month command of finch at shanghai on 5 october 1937 rickover was assigned to the cavite navy yard in the philippines and was transferred shortly thereafter to the bureau of engineering in washington dc once there he took up his duties as assistant chief of the electrical section of the bureau of engineering on 15 august 1939 on 10 april 1942 after america s entry into world war ii rickover flew to pearl harbor to organize repairs to the electrical power plant of uss california rickover had been promoted to the rank of commander on 1 january 1942 and in late june of that year was made a temporary captain in late 1944 he appealed for a transfer to an active command he was sent to investigate inefficiencies at the naval supply depot at mechanicsburg pennsylvania having identified a number of problems there he was appointed in july 1945 to command of a ship repair facility on okinawa later in the war his service as head of the electrical section in the bureau of ships brought him a legion of merit and gave him experience in directing large development programs choosing talented technical people and working closely with private industry time magazine featured him on the cover of its january 11 1954 issue the accompanying article described his wartime service sharp tongued hyman rickover spurred his men to exhaustion ripped through red tape drove contractors into rages he went on making enemies but by the end of the war he had won the rank of captain he had also won a reputation as a man who gets things done naval reactors and the atomic energy commission edit see also naval reactors admiral rickover looking over uss nautilus the world s first nuclear powered vessel in december 1945 rickover was appointed inspector general of the 19th fleet on the west coast and was assigned to work with general electric at schenectady new york to develop a nuclear propulsion plant for destroyers in 1946 an initiative was begun at the manhattan project s clinton laboratory now the oak ridge national laboratory to develop a nuclear electric generating plant realizing the potential that nuclear energy held for the navy rickover applied rickover was sent to oak ridge through the efforts of his wartime boss rear admiral earle mills who became the head of the navy s bureau of ships that same year rickover became an early convert to the idea of nuclear marine propulsion and was the driving force for shifting the navy s initial focus from applications on destroyers to submarines rickover s vision was not initially shared by his immediate superiors he was recalled from oak ridge and assigned advisory duties with an office in an abandoned ladies room in the navy building he subsequently went around several layers of superior officers and in 1947 went directly to the chief of naval operations fleet admiral chester nimitz also a former submariner nimitz immediately understood the potential of nuclear propulsion in submarines and recommended the project to the secretary of the navy john l sullivan sullivan s endorsement to build the world s first nuclear powered vessel uss nautilus later caused rickover to state that sullivan was the true father of the nuclear navy subsequently rickover became chief of a new section in the bureau of ships the nuclear power division and began work with alvin m weinberg the oak ridge director of research to initiate and develop the oak ridge school of reactor technology and to begin the design of the pressurized water reactor for submarine propulsion in february 1949 he was assigned to the atomic energy commission s division of reactor development and then assumed control of the navy s effort as director of the naval reactors branch reporting to mills this twin role enabled him to lead the effort to develop nautilus the decision to select rickover as head of development of the nation s nuclear submarine program ultimately rested with admiral mills according to lieutenant general leslie groves director of the manhattan project mills was anxious to have a very determined man involved he knew that rickover was not too easy to get along with and not too popular but in his judgement rickover was the man whom the navy could depend on no matter what opposition he might encounter groves agreed with mill s proposal for a training program for naval officers and authorised his deputy kenneth nichols and mills to work out the details mills said he had a captain rickover who could head the group and gave nichols six industrial references known to nichols nichols phoned them and found that three of them thought rickover was an outstanding imaginative and capable engineer but at times difficult to get along with whereas the other three admitted he might have some capabilities but claimed it was impossible to deal with the man after talking with rickover on a flight to oak ridge he told mills rickover will do it would be interesting to see what happens rickover and the team did not disappoint the result was a highly reliable nuclear reactor in a form factor that would fit into a submarine hull with no more than a 28 foot beam this became known as the s1w reactor nautilus was launched and commissioned with this reactor in 1954 later rickover oversaw the development of the shippingport atomic power station the first commercial pressurized water reactor nuclear power plant kenneth nichols of the aec decided that the rickover westinghouse pressurised water reactor intended for an aircraft carrier program that was cancelled was the best choice for a reactor to demonstrate the production of electricity with rickover having a going organization and a reactor project under way that now had no specific use to justify it this was accepted by lewis strauss and the commission in january 1954 rickover was promoted to vice admiral in 1958 the same year that he was awarded the first of two congressional gold medals he exercised tight control for the next three decades over the ships technology and personnel of the nuclear navy interviewing and approving or denying every prospective officer being considered for a nuclear ship over the course of rickover s career these personal interviews numbered in the tens of thousands over 14000 interviews were with recent college graduates alone the interviewees ranged from midshipmen and newly commissioned ensigns destined for nuclear powered submarines and surface combatants to very senior combat experienced naval aviator captains who sought command of nuclear powered aircraft carriers the content of most of these interviews has been lost to history though some were later chronicled in several books on rickover s career as well as in a rare personal interview with diane sawyer in 1984 safety record edit rickover s stringent standards are largely credited with being responsible for the us navy s continuing record of zero reactor accidents defined as the uncontrolled release of fission products to the environment resulting from damage to a reactor core he made it a point to be aboard during the initial sea trial of almost every nuclear submarine completing its new construction period following the three mile island meltdown on march 28 1979 admiral rickover was asked to testify before congress in the general context of answering the question as to why naval nuclear propulsion had succeeded in achieving a record of zero reactor accidents as opposed to the dramatic one that had just taken place in his testimony he said i am always chagrined at the tendency of people to expect that i have a simple easy gimmick that makes my program function any successful program functions as an integrated whole of many factors trying to select one aspect as the key one will not work each element depends on all the others the accident free record of united states navy reactor operations stands in stark contrast to those of the soviet union which had fourteen known reactor accidents as stated in a retrospective analysis in october 2007 us submarines far outperformed the soviet ones in the crucial area of stealth and rickover s obsessive fixation on safety and quality control gave the us nuclear navy a vastly superior safety record to the soviet one this was especially crucial as in a democratic society particularly after the three mile island nuclear power station crisis in march 1979 a host of nuclear accidents or well publicized near misses could have shut down the nuclear fleet completely as head of naval reactors rickover s focus and responsibilities were dedicated to reactor safety rather than tactical or strategic submarine warfare training however this extreme focus was well known during rickover s era as a potential hindrance to balancing operational priorities one way by which this was addressed after the admiral retired was that only the very strongest former at sea submarine commanders have held rickover s now unique eight year position as navsea 08 the longest chartered tenure in the us military from rickover s first replacement kinnaird r mckee to today s head of naval reactors james f caldwell jr all have held command of nuclear submarines their squadrons and ocean fleets but not one has been a long term engineering duty officer such as rickover views on nuclear power edit given rickover s single minded focus on naval nuclear propulsion design and operations it came as a surprise to many in 1982 near the end of his career when he testified before the us congress that were it up to him what to do with nuclear powered ships he would sink them all at a congressional hearing rickover testified that i do not believe that nuclear power is worth it if it creates radiation then you might ask me why do i have nuclear powered ships that is a necessary evil i would sink them all i am not proud of the part i played in it i did it because it was necessary for the safety of this country that s why i am such a great exponent of stopping this whole nonsense of war unfortunately limits attempts to limit war have always failed the lesson of history is when a war starts every nation will ultimately use whatever weapon it has available every time you produce radiation you produce something that has a certain half life in some cases for billions of years it is important that we control these forces and try to eliminate them economics of defense policy hearing before the joint economic committee congress of the united states 97th cong 2nd sess pt 1 1982 a few months later following his retirement rickover spoke more specifically regarding the questions could you comment on your own responsibility in helping to create a nuclear navy do you have any regrets i do not have regrets i believe i helped preserve the peace for this country why should i regret that what i accomplished was approved by congress which represents our people all of you live in safety from domestic enemies because of security from the police likewise you live in safety from foreign enemies because our military keeps them from attacking us nuclear technology was already under development in other countries my assigned responsibility was to develop our nuclear navy i managed to accomplish this controversy edit rickover has been declared in retrospect as the most famous and controversial admiral of his era hyperactive political blunt confrontational insulting flamboyant and a workaholic rickover was always demanding of others without regard for rank or position as well as himself moreover he had little tolerance for mediocrity none for stupidity if a man is dumb said a friend rickover thinks he ought to be dead even while a captain rickover did not conceal his opinions and many of the officers whom he regarded as dumb eventually rose in rank to be admirals and were assigned to the pentagon rickover found himself frequently and loudly in bureaucratic combat with these senior naval officers to the point that he almost missed becoming an admiral two selection boards passed over captain rickover for promotion one of these selection boards even met the day after uss nautilus had its keel laying ceremony in the presence of president truman and indicative of the navy s attitude toward the ship s creator rickover had not been originally invited and was only eventually invited by way of his aec role not his navy role it eventually took the intervention of the white house us congress and the secretary of the navy and the very real threat of changing the navy s admiral selection system to include civilians before the next flag selection board welcomed the twice passed over rickover normally a career ending event into their ranks rickover s military authority and congressional mandate were absolute with regard to the us fleet s reactor operations but his exceptional degree of control was frequently a subject of internal navy controversy he was head of the naval reactors branch and thus responsible for signing off on a crew s competence to operate the reactor safely giving him the power to effectively remove a warship from active service and he did so on several occasions much to the consternation of those affected the view became established that he sometimes exercised power to settle scores or tweak noses even the most senior renowned and professionally accomplished nuclear trained officers that rickover had personally selected such as edward l beach jr had mixed feelings about the kindly old gentleman or simply kog as rickover became euphemistically known in inner circles beach in his later years once referred to him as a tyrant with no account of his gradually failing powers p 179 united states submarines 2002 focus on education edit president kennedy and rickover white house 1963 when he was a child still living in russian occupied poland rickover was not allowed to attend public schools because of his jewish faith starting at the age of four he attended a religious school where the teaching was solely from the tanakh ie old testament in hebrew following his formal education in the us admiral rickover developed a decades long and outspoken interest in the educational standards of the united states rickover believed that us standards of education were unacceptably low his first book centered on education was a collection of essays calling for improved standards of education particularly in math and science entitled education and freedom 1959 in it he stated that education is the most important problem facing the united states today and only the massive upgrading of the scholastic standards of our schools will guarantee the future prosperity and freedom of the republic a second book swiss schools and ours 1962 was a scathing comparison of the educational systems of switzerland and america he argued that the higher standards of swiss schools including a longer school day and year combined with an approach stressing student choice and academic specialization produced superior results recognizing that nurturing careers of excellence and leadership in science and technology in young scholars is an essential investment in the united states national and global future following his retirement rickover founded the center for excellence in education in 1983 additionally the research science institute formerly the rickover science institute founded by admiral rickover in 1984 is a summer science program hosted by the massachusetts institute of technology for high school seniors from around the world the general dynamics scandal edit in the early 1980s structural welding flaws whose nature and existence had been covered up by falsified inspection records led to significant delays and expenses in the delivery of several submarines being built at the general dynamics electric boat division shipyard the yard tried to pass the vast cost overruns directly on to the navy while rickover demanded that the yard make good on its shoddy workmanship the navy settled with general dynamics in 1981 paying out 634 million of 843 million in los angeles class submarine cost overrun and reconstruction claims secretary of the navy john lehman was partly motivated to seek the agreement in order to continue to focus on achieving president reagan s goal of a 600 ship navy but rickover was extremely bitter over the general dynamics yard being paid hundreds of millions of dollars for its incompetence and deceit and lambasted both the settlement and secretary lehman this was not rickover s first clash with the defense industry he was historically hard even harsh in exacting high standards from defense contractors as a result of investigations into the scandal a navy ad hoc gratuities board determined that rickover had received gifts from general dynamics over a 16 year period valued at 67628 including jewelry furniture exotic knives and gifts that rickover had in turn presented to us politicians charges were investigated as well that gifts were provided by two other major nuclear ship contractors for the navy general electric and the newport news shipbuilding and dry dock secretary lehman admonished rickover for his impropriety via a nonpunitive letter and stated that rickover s fall from grace with these little trinkets should be viewed in the context of his enormous contributions to the navy rickover released a statement through his lawyer saying his conscience is clear with respect to the gifts no gratuity or favor ever affected any decision i made senator william proxmire of wisconsin a longtime supporter of rickover later publicly associated a debilitating stroke suffered by the admiral to his having been censured and dragged through the mud by the very institution to which he rendered his invaluable service forced retirement edit by the late 1970s rickover s position seemed stronger than it had ever been over many years powerful friends on both the house and senate armed services committees ensured that he remained on active duty long after most other admirals had retired from their second careers however secretary of the navy john lehman felt that rickover was hindering the well being of the navy as lehman stated in his book command of the seas one of my first orders of business as secretary of the navy would be to solve the rickover problem rickover s legendary achievements were in the past his present viselike grip on much of the navy was doing it much harm i had sought the job because i believed the navy had deteriorated to the point where its weakness seriously threatened our future security the navy s grave afflictions included loss of a strategic vision loss of self confidence and morale a prolonged starvation of resources leaving vast shortfalls in capability to do the job and too few ships to cover a sea so great all resulting in cynicism exhaustion and an undercurrent of defeatism the cult created by admiral rickover was itself a major obstacle to recovery entwining nearly all the issues of culture and policy within the navy secretary lehman eventually attained enough political clout to enforce his decision to retire rickover this was in part assisted by the admiral s nearly insubordinate stance against paying the general dynamics submarine construction claims as well as his advanced age and waning political leverage on july 27 1981 lehman was handed the final impetus for ending rickover s career by way of an operational error on the admiral s part a moderate loss of ship control and depth excursion while performing a submerged crash back maneuver during the sea trials of the newly constructed uss la jolla rickover was the actual man in charge during this specific performance test and his actions and inactions were judged to have been the causal factor on january 31 1982 four days after his 82nd birthday rickover was forced to retire from the navy after 63 years of service under 13 presidents woodrow wilson through ronald reagan according to rickover he first learned of his firing when his wife told him what she heard on the radio according to former president jimmy carter several weeks following his retirement rickover was invited to the oval office and decided to don his full dress uniform he told me that he refused to take a seat listened to the president ask him to be his special nuclear advisor replied mr president that is bullshit and then walked out the navy s official investigation of general dynamics electric boat division was ended shortly afterward according to theodore rockwell rickover s technical director for more than 15 years more than one source at that time stated that general dynamics officials were bragging around washington that they had gotten rickover admiral rickover s final public remarks after his retirement included a lecture in may 1982 at the morgenthau memorial lecture series under the auspices of the carnegie council for ethics in international affairs the voice for ethics in international policy developed and polished over the course of the last five of his 63 years of public service on february 28 1983 a postretirement party honoring admiral rickover was attended by all three living former us presidents at the time nixon ford and carter all formerly officers in the us navy president reagan was not in attendance death edit headstone of admiral hyman g rickover arlington national cemetery memorial day 2017 after suffering strokes pneumonia and generally declining health over time admiral rickover died at his home in arlington virginia on july 8 1986 at 86 years of age the same as that of his father he was buried on july 11 in a small private ceremony at arlington national cemetery on july 14 memorial services were led by admiral james d watkins at the washington national cathedral with president carter secretary of state george p shultz secretary lehman senior naval officers and about 1000 other people in attendance mrs rickover had asked president carter to read from john milton s on his blindness carter was at first puzzled by her choice but then came to believe that the last line had special meaning for all wives and family members of submariners who were away at sea they also serve who only stand and wait admiral rickover is buried in section 5 at arlington national cemetery his first wife ruth masters rickover 1903 1972 is buried with him and the name of his second wife eleonore a bednowicz rickover whom he met and married while

external links history edit \u00a3 1 note issued from london in 1805 one pound notes were introduced by the bank of england for the first time in 1797 following gold shortages caused by the french revolutionary wars the earliest notes were handwritten and were issued as needed to individuals these notes were written on one side only and bore the name of the payee the date and the signature of the issuing cashier between 1797 and 1821 the lack of bullion meant that banks would not exchange banknotes for gold but after the end of the napoleonic wars the shortage was alleviated such that notes could be exchanged for an equivalent amount of gold when presented at the bank one pound notes ceased to be issued in 1821 and were replaced by gold sovereigns during the first world war the british government wanted to maintain its stocks of gold and so banks were ordered to again stop exchanging any and all denominations of banknotes for gold gold sovereigns were replaced by one pound notes issued by the treasury these notes were nicknamed bradburys because of the prominent signature of sir john bradbury permanent secretary to the treasury displayed on the notes britain returned to the gold standard in 1925 although the bank of england was only obliged to exchange notes for gold in multiples of 400 troy ounces 12000 g the typical size of a good delivery bar or more the responsibility for the printing of one pound notes was transferred to the bank of england in 1928 and the ability to redeem banknotes for gold ceased in 1931 when britain stopped using the gold standard the emergency wartime issue of 1940 48 the bank of england s first postworld war i one pound notes were two sided green notes which were printed not handwritten the name of the payee was replaced by the declaration i promise to pay the bearer on demand the sum of one pound this declaration remains on bank of england banknotes to this day this signature of the issuing cashier was replaced by the printed signature of the chief cashier of the bank of england in 1940 following the outbreak of the second world war one pound notes were issued in a new blue orange colour scheme to deter counterfeiters although the design remained the same at the same time metal thread running the paper was introduced as a security feature after the war one pound notes were issued in their original green colour the earliest postworld war ii notes did not have the metallic thread security feature but those issued from september 1948 onward did a new design for one pound notes was introduced in 1960 with the old notes ceasing to be legal tender in 1962 these new series c notes were slightly narrower and were the first one pound notes to feature a portrait of queen elizabeth ii on the front the reverse design incorporated the logo of the bank of england series c notes were replaced by the series d notes from 1978 onward these slightly smaller notes featured an entirely new design with queen elizabeth ii on the front and scientist isaac newton on the back the note was redesigned slightly in 1981 to feature brighter background colours following a consultation with retailers and other groups it was announced on 31 july 1981 that the one pound note would be replaced by a one pound coin part of the reason for this change was that notes on average lasted only nine months in general circulation while coins could last forty years or more the government also believed that the growing vending industry would benefit from the introduction of a one pound coin the new cupro nickel coin was introduced on 21 april 1983 and the one pound note ceased to be legal tender on 11 march 1988 designs edit note first issued last issued ceased to be legal tender colour size

antagonist tibialis anterior muscle identifiers ta a04 702 044 fma 22541 anatomical terms of muscle edit on wikidata the gastrocnemius muscle plural gastrocnemii is a superficial two headed muscle that is in the back part of the lower leg of humans it runs from its two heads just above the knee to the heel a two joint muscle the muscle is named via latin from greek \u03b3\u03b1\u03c3\u03c4\u03ae\u03c1 stomach and \u03ba\u03bd\u03ae\u03bc\u03b7 kn\u1e17m\u0113 leg meaning stomach of leg referring to the bulging shape of the calf contents hide 1 structure 11 variation 2 function 21 motor pathway 3 clinical significance 4 history 5 additional images 6 references 7 external links structure edit the gastrocnemius is located with the soleus in the posterior back compartment of the leg the lateral head originates from the lateral condyle of the femur while the medial head originates from the medial condyle of the femur its other end forms a common tendon with the soleus muscle this tendon is known as the calcaneal tendon or achilles tendon and inserts onto the posterior surface of the calcaneus or heel bone further it is considered a superficial muscle as it is located directly under skin so its shape is clearly visible in a normal human being deep to the gastrocnemius farther from the skin is the soleus muscle some anatomists consider both to be a single muscle the triceps surae or three headed muscle of the calf since they share a common insertion via the achilles tendon the plantaris muscle and a portion of its tendon run between the two muscles which is involved in locking the knee from the standing position since the anterior compartment of the leg is lateral to the tibia the bulge of muscle medial to the tibia on the anterior side is actually the posterior compartment the soleus is superficial to the midshaft of the tibia variation edit 10 to 30 of individuals have a sesamoid bone called the fabella in the lateral outer head of gastrocnemius muscle function edit along with the soleus muscle the gastrocnemius forms half of the calf muscle its function is plantar flexing the foot at the ankle joint and flexing the leg at the knee joint the gastrocnemius is primarily involved in running jumping and other fast movements of leg and to a lesser degree in walking and standing this specialization is connected to the predominance of white muscle fibers type ii fast twitch present in the gastrocnemius as opposed to the soleus which has more red muscle fibers type i slow twitch and is the primary active muscle when standing still as determined by emg studies motor pathway edit the plan to use the gastrocnemius in running jumping knee and plantar flexing is created in the precentral gyrus in the cerebrum of the brain once a plan is produced the signal is sent to and down an upper motor neuron the signal is passed through the internal capsule and decussates or crosses in the medulla oblongata specifically in the lateral corticospinal tract the signal continues down through the anterior horn of the spinal cord where the upper motor neuron synapses with the lower motor neuron signal propagation continues down the anterior rami lumbar 4 5 and sacral 1 5 of the sacral plexus the sciatic nerve branches off of the sacral plexus in which the tibial and common fibular nerves are wrapped in one sheath the tibial nerve eventually separates from the sciatic nerve and innervates the gastrocnemius muscle thus completing the plan the brain had originally started with so that the actions of running standing

khmer territory edit beginning in the early 17th century colonization of the area by vietnamese settlers gradually isolated the khmer of the mekong delta from their brethren in cambodia proper and

area of prey nokor and to set up a customs house there increasing waves of vietnamese settlers which the cambodian kingdom could not impede because it was weakened by war with thailand slowly vietnamized the area in time prey nokor became known as saigon prey nokor was the most important commercial seaport to the khmers the loss of the city and the rest of the mekong delta cut off cambodia

only has 3 human friends that always stand by his side no matter what crazy scenario is going on however he has the biggest bond with roger because they are always going from one crazy adventure to another they even made a fake detective agency where they even came up with their own nicknames steve is wheels and roger is the legman steve s original design was much geekier and gawky and he was voiced by ricky blitt halfway through production grimes replaced blitt and steve s design was made to be more attractive so he would be less comparable to neil goldman from family guy contents hide 1 personality 2 friends 3 romance 4 references 5 external links personality edit steve smith is the baby of the family stan and francine s high school aged son he attends pearl bailey high school steve is portrayed as an enthusiastic ambitious and wimpy nerd in the official series he is not presented as nerdy as he is in the show s unaired precursory pilot when his appearance voice and manner greatly contrasted from what they would eventually become in the precursory pilot steve was also gawkier scrawnier and voiced by ricky blitt as opposed to scott grimes in the official series he s become emphasized as soft emotional cute and endearing as part of his emotional and sensitive character steve is combined with a screechy wail despite his wimpy and nerdy characteristics steve is particularly conceited and obnoxious he is all too often a showman always ready to put on a performance and show off his talents typically singing dance wise steve is usually accompanied by his equally uncool friends snot steve s closest friend with whom he shares a bromance the two once even having shared in a kiss together in the episode license to till toshi who is an asian american and only speaks japanese and barry who is morbidly obese with an inarticulate strident and sloppy vocal quality steve possesses a keen interest in the opposite sex and has had an obese girlfriend debbie to which stan disapproved steve s relationship with his father is strained with stan often behaving judgmentally and intolerantly over steve s nerdiness immaturity and sensitivity steve has been known to cop attitude sometimes rightfully so at stan over his offensive acts steve was born on october 7 he is portrayed as a stereotypical geek he is a bit of a social outcast wears thick glasses and harbors a strong academic interest in science especially chemistry more typically geeky traits of steve s include his interests in dungeons dragons harry potter and star wars like most unpopular students steve is often physically and verbally picked on by the bullies of the more popular social circle steve s father stan is often frustrated with steve as he would prefer that steve engage in activities that would improve his social standing like sports a conflict that was first explored in the first season episode all about steve stan sometimes attempts to change steve usually unsuccessfully as when he once gave steve an experimental performance enhancer the steroid caused steve to grow female breasts but also ironically made him more popular at school steve looks up to his dad as a role model but his na\u00efvete often leads him to follow his dad s advice or convictions seemingly blindly this led him to once openly display homophobia another time steve received a failing grade on a presentation about fossils using information he got from stan because he thought his dad was intelligent despite roger s attempts to convince him otherwise steve s mother francine does not care that steve is a geek and is more protective of him seeing him as her baby a status she once attempted to prolong by using a special drug to keep him from reaching puberty steve s red hair comes from francine who actually dyes her hair blonde steve does not share many interests with his sister hayley but has occasionally collaborated with her on schemes such as when they tried to break up a young couple so hayley could get the guy and steve the girl which ended up backfiring on both of them getting the couple killed they have also tried to teach both of their parents individual lessons like when they tried to teach francine not to be racist only to learn that she was actually prejudiced against left handed people or when they exacted revenge against stan for turning a homeless shelter into a bumfight business steve and roger play video games together get advice from each other and come up with schemes together for example he once planned to make a girls gone wild type video and market it in order to generate money to buy a video game console in another scheme steve and roger ran away to new york city to make their fortunes while the rest of the family thought killed when lightning set the family s treehouse on fire steve s tendency to inflate his own ego combined with roger s easily irritated and vindictive nature often leads the latter to physically abuse or play a prank on steve because of a real or perceived slight or insult occasionally steve gets even like when he once conned roger out of 50000 despite their love hate relationship steve considers roger his best friend even once intervening to rescue the alien from an abusive relationship a freshman at pearl bailey high school steve is a highly capable musician having taken up the cello to once impress a girl in a later episode however steve says that he has been playing the cello since he was nine steve also plays guitar and sings which he did as part of a band in the episode american dream factory in fact both of the songs steve s band rehearses livin on the run and sunset blvd were originally recorded by scott grimes who voices steve among steve s other talents are being able to read elvish use morse code and communicate with dolphins while academically skilled steve is also quite na\u00efve and not socially savvy for example he knows more about the new york stock exchange than about prostitution as a result he can sometimes be tricked into believing outrageously implausible lies roger typically takes advantage of this especially when he is upset with steve or when he is simply bored once roger made steve believe he was not really stan and francine s biological child another time roger tricked steve into believing he was an adolescent wizard and took him to a drug dealer s house telling him it was secretly a wizard s school and the drug lab inside a potions class although normally even tempered and relatively tolerant steve cries when he is notably upset but he has also had uncontrolled bursts of rage during which he breaks nearby objects and screams very loudly if pressed hard enough steve will also hit or attack people such as when he beat up beauregard la fontaine for insulting his father even though he is generally not aggressive or an adept fighter as he was unable to even make a fist in bully for steve for example he also uses childhood paraphernalia that teenagers have typically outgrown such as the teddy bear he is implied to sleep with in live and let fry and the care bears towel he is revealed to use in camp refoogee steve has also been shown to occasionally struggle with both substance abuse and an addiction to power in an apocalypse to remember steve claims to be hooked on hallucinogenic berries which ultimately turn out to be poisonous in a later episode steve develops an addiction to the energy drink cougar boost at one point going as far as to defraud his friends with fake tickets in order to obtain money to procure more of the beverage in the episode virtual in stanity francine derides stan for picking up a drug bunny as a last minute gift in the process reminding stan that they just barely got steve off the heroin from stan s previous last second gift in both the pilot episode and you debt your life steve demonstrates an addiction to power in the former case by taking over the school after being turned down by a girl he was trying to impress in the latter case due to his obsession with making the morning announcements and deciding what is worth broadcasting to the high school furthermore as shown in the episode jenny fromdabloc it is revealed that among his four friends steve is considered to be the leader of the group going as far back as elementary school prompting roger to call steve the king of the nerds in most cases when his role as the leader of the group is threatened steve s drive to maintain this position of power results in erratic behavior such as humiliating his friends with personal or compromising information or threats of physical violence against himself or others in nearly every case outside of his immediate circle of friends steve s position of power or authority ends up stripped or removed from him or in rare cases remains with him in a curtailed capacity as was the case in i am the walrus in hurricane it appeared that steve might have a fetish for asians and pregnant women either separately or even both when francine found multiple magazines in steve s bedroom stanny slickers ii the legend of ollie s gold and stan time also imply that steve has a fetish for robotic women in the former episode he tried to build a date out of a vacuum cleaner and was shown to have a fully functioning female robot in stan s vision of the future where stan is

david akers 39 and vinatieri who now has 51 after he added 25 with the indianapolis colts adding to this wide receiver julian edelman made a new record of most receptions yards in the playoff by a

married adolescents \u00a7 1 juschg 5 the youth protection act uses the term branntwein which was originally the german word for brandy to refer to all distilled alcohol beverages branntwein has been superseded by weinbrand in modern german to specifically refer to brandy because of moral panic involving alcohol abuse among minors a 16 year old boy died after having consumed 45 shots of tequila in a bar in early 2007 some people demanded that the drinking age be raised most politicians however spoke against that notion pointing out instead that such abuse was already forbidden according to current laws which simply needed to be enforced in germany and the rest of europe alcohol consumption by adolescents is traditional and generally accepted enforcement edit police operation in bensheim hesse several young people have to dispose of illegally obtained alcoholic beverages in the sewers because they have not reached the required age limit violation of restraints will involve prosecution for vendors who sell alcohol to underage persons and also for bystanders who do not intervene in underage drinking although restrictions are nationwide and well known some salespersons violate the law at times minors themselves can never be prosecuted for alcohol consumption under age supermarkets and stores generally check minors for their identity card the law is less thoroughly enforced in many bars and restaurants but this can vary by location in 2008 the federal state of lower saxony started a series of trap purchases conducted by specially trained police cadets aged 16 or 17 who pose as customers in 77 of all tests alcohol was sold illegally in shops filling stations and kiosks in 2009 about 3000 trap purchases were carried out in lower saxony in 1327 cases 44 alcohol was sold without age verification to underage persons hundreds of summary proceedings led to administrative fines ranging from 500 to 3000 euros the standard rate for the illegal sale of one bottle of spirits is 1500 euros thus alcohol trap purchases bring a return of around \u20ac 2 million annually other german states especially schleswig holstein are considering implementing the lower saxony model but

alcohol remains possible at these times alcohol ban in nikolaistra\u00dfe beyond this germany has very few restrictions on alcohol consumption in public exceptions are sometimes made in the context of highly controversial football soccer matches where police executives may ban the sale of alcoholic drinks inside stadiums and deny entrance to drunk fans in 2009 the private railway company metronom which operates in parts of northern germany introduced a much discussed complete ban on alcohol in its trains some cities have banned alcohol consumption in certain areas and at certain times such as g\u00f6ttingen in nikolaistra\u00dfe between midnight and 8 00 am on saturdays and sundays or in hannover hauptbahnhof until 2009 it was acceptable for employees in many fields of work especially

{"text_id": "3987", "text": "document: designated hitter wikipedia designated hitter jump to navigation search in baseball the designated hitter rule is the common name for major league baseball rule 511 adopted by the american league in 1973 the rule allows teams to have one player known as the designated hitter abbreviated dh to bat in place of the pitcher since 1973 most collegiate amateur and professional leagues have adopted the rule or some variant mlb s national league and nippon professional baseball s central league are the most prominent professional leagues that do not use a designated hitter edgar mart\u00ednez who spent most of his career as the full time designated hitter for the seattle mariners contents hide 1 major league baseball rule 11 interleague play and exhibitions 2 background and history 3 awards 4 debate 5 designated hitter outside major league baseball 51 minor league baseball 52 international baseball leagues 53 amateur baseball 6 sources 7 references 8 further reading 9 external links major league baseball rule edit in major league baseball the designated hitter is a hitter who does not play a position but instead fills in the batting order for the pitcher the dh may only be used for the pitcher and not any other position player as stated in rule 511 use of the dh is optional but must be determined prior to the start of the game if a team does not begin a game with a dh the pitcher or a pinch hitter must bat for the entire game the designated hitter may be replaced as dh only by a player who has not entered the game if a pinch hitter bats for or a pinch runner runs for the dh that pinch hitter or pinch runner becomes the dh the designated hitter can be moved to a fielding position during the game if the dh is moved to another position his team forfeits the role of the designated hitter and the pitcher or another player the latter possible only in case of a multiple substitution would bat in the spot of the position player replaced by the former dh if the designated hitter is moved to pitcher any subsequent pitcher or pinch hitter thereof would bat should that spot in the batting order come up again except for a further multiple substitution likewise if a pinch hitter bats for a nonpitcher and then remains in the game as the pitcher the team would forfeit the use of the dh for the remainder of the game and the player who was dh would become a position player or exit the game unlike other positions the dh is locked into the batting order no multiple substitution may be made to alter the batting rotation of the dh in other words a double switch involving the dh and a position player is not legal for example if the dh is batting fourth and the catcher is batting eighth the manager can not replace both players so as to have the new catcher bat fourth and the new dh bat eighth once a team loses its dh under any of the scenarios discussed in the previous paragraph the double switch becomes fully available and may well be used via necessity should the former dh be replaced in the lineup interleague play and exhibitions edit see also home advantage \u00a7 causes in major league baseball during interleague play the application of the dh rule is determined by the identity of the home team with the rules of the home team s league applying to both teams if the game is played in an american league park the designated hitter may be used in a national league park the pitcher must bat or else be replaced with a pinch hitter on june 12 1997 san francisco giants outfielder glenallen hill became the first national league player to dh in a regular season game when the giants met the american league s texas rangers at the ballpark in arlington in interleague play at first the dh rule was not applied to the world series from 1973 to 1975 all world series games were played under national league rules with no dh and pitchers batting for 1976 it was decided the dh rule would apply to all games in a world series regardless of venue but only in even numbered years cincinnati reds first baseman dan driessen became the first national league player to act as a dh in any capacity regular season or postseason when he was listed as the dh in the first game he was the dh in all four series games that year this practice lasted through 1985 beginning in 1986 the dh rule was used in games played in the stadium of the american league representative there was initially no dh in the all star game beginning in 1989 the rule was applied only to games played in american league stadiums during this era if the all star game was scheduled for an american league stadium fans would vote in the dh for the american league s starting lineup while the national league s manager decided that league s starting dh since 2010 the designated hitter has always been used by both teams regardless of where the game is played in spring training games the home team chooses whether the designated hitter is used occasionally national league teams opt to use the designated hitter usually when a player is recovering from an injury background and history edit the rationale for the designated hitter rule arose comparatively early in the history of professional baseball it was observed that with a few exceptions most notably babe ruth who began his career as a pitcher with the boston red sox pitchers are usually selected for the quality of their pitching not their hitting and that most pitchers were weak hitters who had to be batted ninth in the batting order and pinch hit for late in games when their team was trailing the designated hitter idea was raised by philadelphia athletics manager connie mack in 1906 though he was not the first to propose it the rumors were that he grew weary of watching eddie plank and charles bender flail at pitches when at bat mack s proposal received little support and was even lambasted by the press as wrong theoretically the notion did not die in the late 1920s national league president john heydler made a number of attempts to introduce a 10th man designated hitter as a way to speed up the game and almost convinced national league clubs to agree to try it during spring training in 1929 however momentum to implement the dh did not pick up until the pitching dominance of the late 1960s in 1968 denny mclain won 31 games and bob gibson had a 112 era while carl yastrzemski led the american league in hitting with only a 301 average after the season the rules were changed to lower the mound from 15 to 10 inches and change the upper limit of the strike zone from the top of a batter s shoulders to his armpits in addition in 1969 spring training both the american league and national league agreed to try the designated pinch hitter dph but they did not agree on the implementation most nl teams chose not to participate on march 6 1969 two games utilized the new dph rule for the very first time two newly formed expansion teams the montreal expos and the kansas city royals would participate in one such game and the new york yankees and washington senators in the other on march 26 1969 major league baseball nixed the idea for the time being however a four year trial in which the international league and four other minor leagues started using the dh for their games began that year like other experimental baseball rule changes of the 1960s and 70s the dh was embraced by oakland a s owner charlie o finley on january 11 1973 finley and the other american league owners voted 8 4 to approve the designated hitter for a three year trial run on april 6 1973 ron blomberg of the new york yankees became the first designated hitter in major league baseball history facing boston red sox right handed pitcher luis tiant in his first plate appearance boomer blomberg was walked the result of the first season of the dh was that the american league posted a higher batting average than the national league something which has remained consistent to this day in response to increases in american league attendance because of the designated hitter the national league held a yes no vote on august 13 1980 to determine whether or not the league would adopt the designated hitter a majority of the 12 member teams was necessary to pass the rule and the measure was expected to pass however when the teams were informed that the rule would not come into effect until the 1982 season philadelphia phillies vice president bill giles was unsure of how the team owner ruly carpenter wanted him to vote unable to contact carpenter who was on a fishing trip giles was forced to abstain from voting prior to the meeting harding peterson general manager for the pittsburgh pirates was told to side with the phillies the final tally was four teams voting for the dh atlanta braves new york mets st louis cardinals and san diego padres five votes against chicago cubs cincinnati reds los angeles dodgers montreal expos and san francisco giants and three abstentions philadelphia phillies pittsburgh pirates and houston astros five days after that meeting the cardinals fired their general manager john clairborne who was the leading proponent for the adoption of the dh rule and the national league has not held another vote on the issue as time passed the designated hitter rule has ended up offering american league managers multiple strategic options in setting their teams lineups they can rotate the dh role among part time players for example using a left handed batter against a right handed pitcher and vice versa or they can employ a full time designated hitter against all pitchers it also allows them to give a healthy everyday player a partial day off or to give an injured player the opportunity to bat without exposing him to reinjury while playing in the field in recent years full time dhs have become less common and the position has been used to give players a partial off day allowing them to bat but rest while the other team is batting this option comes in very handy when a team s lineup includes several older players the 2012 yankees for example rotated five players through the dh spot during the season all of them over 34 years old only a handful of players compile over 400 at bats as a dh each year with the houston astros having moved to the american league for the 2013 mlb season which requires interleague play season round as well as the astros to start using a dh full time there is debate within mlb to unify the rules of the two leagues with either the american league returning to its pre1973 rules and have the pitcher hit like the national league or the national league adopting the dh in january 2016 mlb commissioner rob manfred indicated that the national league might adopt the dh for the 2017 season when a new collective bargaining agreement is created after the current one expires on december 31 2016 however he later backtracked on this statement to say that he does not see unification coming any time soon accordingly the dh rule was not adopted by the national league for 2017 awards edit major league baseball presents an annual award to the most outstanding designated hitter of the season called the edgar mart\u00ednez award renamed for the former seattle mariners dh after his retirement in 2004 the outstanding dh award was introduced in 1973 and has been handed out every season since except 1994 due to a player s strike notable winners include mart\u00ednez five times and david ortiz seven times five consecutively dhs have generally not made much impact on the major league baseball most valuable player award or national baseball hall of fame voting because of the relative rareness of the full time dh and the fact that the dh does not contribute on defense during the 1993 season paul molitor became the first player to win the world series most valuable player award while playing 137 of 160 games 8563 as a designated hitter david ortiz did the same in 2013 ortiz was also the first designated hitter to win the alcs mvp in 2004 ortiz and molitor played games at first base in their world series mvp seasons leaving hideki matsui in 2009 as the only world series mvp to never play the field that season among hall of famers paul molitor and jim rice were until 2014 the only inductees to even have played at least 25 of their games at dh with the election of frank thomas on january 8 2014 he becomes the first hall of famer to play the majority of his games at dh edgar mart\u00ednez is currently on the ballot received 704 of votes in 2018 debate edit there is considerable debate over whether or not the designated hitter rule should be removed while some have argued that the national league should adopt it on the other hand there are also fans who enjoy the fact that the american and national leagues use different rules two generations of fans of american league teams have grown up with the designated hitter rule being in place so some may consider the designated hitter to be as much a traditional part of baseball as the pitcher taking his turn at bat is for fans of national league teams critics often argue that use of the designated hitter introduces an asymmetry to the game by separating players into classes creating offensive and defensive specialization more akin to american football opponents of the rule believe it effectively separates pitchers other fielders and designated hitters into separate roles that never cross possibly causing issues with promoting batting cage players whose scope of experience is extremely limited however when the pitcher bats alongside everyone else all nine players must take turns at the plate and in the field and the hybridization of roles requires that everyone knows other roles in addition to their own the designated hitter rule also changes managerial strategy in late innings in the national league a manager must decide when to let a pitcher bat or remove him as well as with whom to pinch hit and where or if that player should take the field afterward when the decision to remove a pitcher is made the manager may also elect to double switch delaying the new pitcher s turn at bat advocates of the designated hitter point to the fact that it has extended many careers and in a few cases created long productive careers for players who are weak fielders or have a history of injuries such as edgar mart\u00ednez and david ortiz hall of fame members george brett carl yastrzemski and paul molitor continued their careers longer than they ordinarily would have without the rule barry bonds who spent his entire career in the national league and actually won eight gold gloves earlier in his career was used strictly as a dh later in his career when the san francisco giants played away interleague games due to his poor fielding some believe that extending careers of older players is less of an advantage and more of a disadvantage filling spots that otherwise may have been taken by younger players who end up not finding a place in the major leagues interleague play has added a new wrinkle to the controversy some feel that it is not fair to ask an al team to play without their dh when their roster has not been set up to do so or on the other hand to ask an nl team to use a dh when they may not have an appropriate player major league baseball commissioner bud selig once proposed that the road team s rules should be followed for interleague games in order to combat this advantage for the home team but the idea has not received traction the decline of pitcher chien ming wang due to an interleague game injury has been cited in support of the designated hitter on june 15 2008 wang was taken out of an interleague game versus the houston astros due to a right foot injury he sustained while running the bases something he was not used to doing since pitchers do not bat in the american league wang was diagnosed with a torn lisfranc ligament and a partial tear of the peroneus longus of the right foot the cast was removed on july 29 but the extensive rehabilitation process prevented wang from being an effective pitcher at the major league level since yankees part owner hank steinbrenner showed frustration with pitchers having to bat in the national league and suggested that the league join the modern age designated hitter outside major league baseball edit minor league baseball edit among minor league baseball teams rookie and single a level leagues use the dh in all games at the double a and triple a level when both teams are national league affiliates pitchers may bat in the pacific coast league pitchers only hit when both clubs are nl affiliates and both clubs agree to have their pitchers hit the reason for the difference is that as players get closer to reaching the majors teams prefer to have the rules mimic as closely as possible those of the major league teams for which the players may soon be playing international baseball leagues edit the dh is used in most professional baseball leagues around the world one notable exception is the central league of japan where pitchers bat as they do in the national league japan s pacific league adopted the designated hitter in 1975 when teams from different leagues play against each other in the japan series or interleague games the dh rule is adopted if the pacific league s team hosts the game the dh rule is used in the japanese minor leagues amateur baseball edit in american high schools and other amateur baseball leagues that use national federation of state high school associations nfhs rules a dh may bat in place of one player in any position not just a pitcher many coaches use a designated hitter in place of the weakest hitter in the lineup if they use one at all in amateur baseball many pitchers are also good hitters and will often play another position or even dh when not pitching japanese high school baseball is one of the few amateur baseball leagues in the world that has never used the designated hitter rule at all in high school baseball in south korea the rule has been adopted since 2004 american legion rules on the other hand allow the dh only to bat for the pitcher prior to 1995 the use of the dh was not allowed in legion baseball at all in college baseball ncaa rules state that the designated hitter must hit for the pitcher but in many instances the pitcher is also a good hitter and the coach may elect to let the pitcher bat in the lineup if the pitcher opts to bat for himself he is treated as two separate positions a pitcher and a designated hitter abbreviated p dh on the lineup card and may be substituted for as such ie if he is removed as the pitcher he may remain as the designated hitter and vice versa however if a player who starts a game as a p dh is relieved as the starting pitcher he may not return to the mound even if he remains in the game as the dh and he may not play any other defensive position after being relieved as the pitcher unless he immediately moves to another defensive position in which case the new pitcher must assume the spot in the batting order of the fielder the p dh substituted for and the dh is lost for the remainder of the game conversely a player who begins the game as the dh but not as the pitcher may come into the game as a reliever and remain as the dh in effect becoming a p dh be relieved on the mound later in the game but continue to bat as the dh in little league baseball the dh is not used however a league may adopt a rule which requires all players present and able to play to be listed in the batting order such that the order contains more than nine players and thus all players will have a turn to bat even when they are not assigned a fielding position players in the batting lineup without a position on the field are given the position designation extra hitter eh a position seen occasionally in other amateur

utricle saccule cochlea semicircular canals the stapes or stirrup is a bone in the middle ear of humans and other mammals which is involved in the conduction of sound vibrations to the inner ear the stirrup shaped small bone is on and transmits these to the oval window medially the stapes is the smallest and lightest named bone in the human body and is so called because of its resemblance to a

of the stapes compared with a 10 cent euro coin the stapes is the third bone of the three ossicles in the middle ear the stapes is a stirrup shaped bone and the smallest in the human body it rests on the oval window to which it is connected by an annular ligament the stapes is described as having a base resting on the oval window as well as a head that articulates with the incus these are connected by anterior and posterior limbs latin crura the stapes articulates with the incus through the incudostapedial joint the stapes is the smallest bone in the human body and measures roughly 3 x 25 mm greater along the head base span development edit the stapes develops from the second pharyngeal arch during the sixth to eighth week of embryological life the central cavity of the stapes the obturator foramen is due to the presence embryologically of the stapedial artery which usually regresses animals edit see also evolution of mammalian auditory ossicles the stapes is one of three ossicles in mammals in nonmammalian four legged animals the bone homologous to the stapes is usually called the columella however in reptiles either term may be used in fish the homologous bone is called the hyomandibular and is part of the gill arch supporting either the spiracle or the jaw depending on the species the equivalent term in amphibians is the pars media plectra variation edit the stapes appears to be relatively constant in size in different ethnic groups in 001 002 of people the stapedial artery does not regress and persists in the central foramen in this case a pulsatile sound may be heard in the affected ear or there may be no symptoms at all rarely the stapes may be completely absent function edit main article hearing situated between the incus and the inner ear the stapes transmits sound vibrations from the incus to the oval window a membrane covered opening to the inner ear the stapes is also stabilized by the stapedius muscle which is innervated by the facial nerve clinical relevance edit otosclerosis is a congenital or spontaneous onset disease characterized by abnormal bone remodeling in the inner ear often this causes the stapes to adhere to the oval window which impedes its ability to conduct sound and is a cause of conductive hearing loss clinical otosclerosis is found in about 1 of people although it is more common in forms that do not cause noticeable hearing loss otosclerosis is more likely in young age groups and females two common treatments are stapedectomy the surgical removal of the stapes and replacement with an artificial prosthesis and stapedotomy the creation of a small hole in the base of the stapes followed by the insertion of an artificial prosthesis into that hole surgery may be complicated by a persistent stapedial artery fibrosis related damage to the base of the bone or obliterative otosclerosis resulting in obliteration of the base history edit the stapes as first described by giovanni filippo ingrassia labeled m bottom right the stapes is commonly described as having been discovered by the professor giovanni filippo ingrassia in 1546 at the university of naples although this remains the nature of some controversy as ingrassia s description was published posthumously in his 1603 anatomical commentary in galeni librum de ossibus doctissima et expectatissima commentaria spanish anatomist pedro jimeno is first to have been credited with a published description in dialogus de re medica 1549 the bone is so named because of its resemblance to a stirrup latin stapes an example of

unsurprisingly cartman turns out to be really good at stopping mexicans the episode was written by series cocreator trey parker and is rated tv ma l in the united states the plot references illegal

butters and then kyle due to butters poor leadership skills attempt to elude the border patrol led by an overly gleeful cartman and cross the border into texas cartman s backyard all of the mexicans do so winning the game much to cartman s irritation however butters is not among his teammates having been lost and when cartman later realizes that butters is not present he realizes the game is not over as butters teammates begin searching for him cartman s team resumes protecting the backyard butters team puts up fliers to help find him to which a vindictive cartman puts up his own telling anyone to find butters to shoot him on sight not caring if he dies as it would help him win the game as butters tries to find his way back he is struck by a passing car the couple in the car believing butters to be a mexican immigrant named mantequilla spanish for butter take him to their home and employ him as a stereotypical mexican servant giving him menial jobs to perform such as cleaning windows and washing dishes however the couple eventually abandons butters at an el pollo loco restaurant believing that butters needs to be with his own kind to be happy inside butters regales the staff with tales of his imaginary exploits the staff recognize him from missing posters put up by his friends and believing him to be someone famous they start to question the value of their new lives in the united states they misinterpret butters desire to cross the border and rejoin his friends as a desire to return to mexico and a mass exodus of mexican emigrants soon begins as more and more mexicans leave americans realize they can not keep up with their newfound menial labor tasks due to having become complacent and lazy creating a labor shortage and damaging the us economy cartman joins the united states border patrol as a volunteer where he is instructed to stop mexicans from crossing the border regardless of the semantics of which direction they are traveling mexican emigrants start being rounded up and ordered to get back to work butters as mantequilla is hailed as a hero in mexico in a scene reminiscent of a similar scene in the film monty python s life of brian he is received in the z\u00f3calo and is credited with instilling a sense of national pride in the mexican people however he soon becomes homesick and attempts to return to the united states while attempting to cross into the united states butters is spotted by border patrol agents who are overjoyed in their belief a mexican wants to enter the united states and make no attempt to stop him recognizing butters an enraged cartman tries to prevent him from crossing the border with the border patrol s help butters successfully eludes cartman and reenters the united states winning the game when the children are reunited at cartman s house cartman once again pouts over his loss of the game as the gang rejoices at butters return when butters suggests he be leader next time stan and kyle suggest that while he is a great mexican team player he is not a great leader of mexicans as it took him more than two weeks to cross the border in response butters stands up and gestures with his hands causing mexicans everywhere to chant in response loudly enough for the boys to hear them an exasperated cartman begins a baptist priest walking into a bar joke and the episode ends production edit in the show s commentary the creator describe their distaste when cops advisers and television producers get together border wars and dea were two of the shows parodied the creators picked

stating the last of the meheecans is nt really about immigration reform so much as it s about the narcissistic viewpoint that america must be as a point of irrefutable fact the best place in the world

help they do nt care about us is the fifth single from michael jackson s album history past present and future book i released on march 31 1996 the song remains one of the most controversial pieces jackson ever composed in the us media scrutiny surrounding allegations of antisemitic lyrics were the catalyst for jackson issuing multiple apologies and rerecording the song with altered lyrics the singer countered allegations of antisemitism arguing that reviews had misinterpreted the context of the song either unintentionally or deliberately the song was accompanied by two music videos directed by spike lee the first was shot in two locations in brazil in pelourinho the historic city centre of salvador and in a favela of rio de janeiro called dona marta where the state authorities had tried to ban all production over fears the video would damage their image the area and prospects of rio de janeiro staging the 2004 olympics still the residents of the area were happy to see the singer hoping their problems would be made visible to a wider audience the second video was shot in a prison and contained video footage of multiple references to human rights abuses commercially the song became a top ten hit in all european countries and number one in germany for three weeks in the us radio stations were reluctant to play the controversial composition it however managed to peak at number 30 on the billboard hot 100 the song was remixed with parts of songs such as privacy from the album invincible and tabloid junkie and released on the immortal album in november 2011 the song was performed during jackson s third and final concert series the history world tour which ran from 1996 to 1997 as part of a medley with scream and in the closet the song was set to be performed on

they do nt really care about us in between the chorus lines one child chants do nt worry what people say we got it true after which another child says enough is enough of this garbage according to the sheet music published on musicnotescom by alfred music publishing they do nt care about us is played in the key of d minor and the track s time signature is common time the song which is cited as being a pop song has a moderately slow tempo of 88 beats per minute instruments used include a piano and guitar jon pareles stated that jackson was calling himself a victim of police brutality and a victim of hate he continued a listener might wonder just who us is supposed to be to make the songs lodge in the ear jackson uses elementary singsong melodies a nyah nyah two note motif in they do nt care about us and he comes up with all kinds of surprises in the arrangements james hunter of rolling stone magazine noted that musically jackson was no longer trying to hide any eccentricities he had he expressed the opinion that in they do nt care about us the pop musician sounded more embattled than ever jim farber of new york daily news said that jackson snarled while singing that the song clicked and has an original clattering rhythm the review of history in the washington times noted of they do nt care about us it follows fast inviting more pathos and more controversy with haunting clapping and a police scanner in the background the sacramento bee described it as a looped reggae lite dance beat the song gained renewed attention and relevance due to its use during black lives matter protests in 2014 and 2015 chart performance edit in the uk it peaked at number four and stayed on the chart for three months the song found particular success in europe peaking within the top ten in all countries european highlights came in austria switzerland france belgium and sweden in these countries the song became a top five hit and stayed in their respective charts for a minimum of 21 weeks the song reached the top of the charts for three weeks in germany and stayed a full 30 weeks in the survey it is the longest consecutive chart run of a michael jackson song in the german charts the lyrical controversy surrounding they do nt care about us brought partial commercial disappointment in the us radio stations were reluctant to play the song it peaked at number 30 on the us billboard hot 100 chart falling short of the record breaking success of the two previous singles scream childhood and you are not alone yet the song peaked at number 10 on the us billboard hot rb singles chart music videos edit the cultural music group olodum from the city of salvador with whom jackson collaborated producing the first video proved to be a difficult task for jackson state authorities unsuccessfully tried to ban the singer filming in salvador pelourinho and in rio de janeiro officials in the state of rio feared images of poverty might affect tourism and accused jackson of exploiting the poor ronaldo cezar coelho the state secretary for industry commerce and tourism demanded editing rights over the finished product stating i do nt see why we should have to facilitate films that will contribute nothing to all our efforts to rehabilitate rio s image some were concerned that scenes of poverty and human rights abuses would affect their chances of hosting the olympics in 2004 others supported jackson s wish to highlight the problems of the region arguing that the government were embarrassed by their own failings a judge banned all filming but this ruling was overturned by an injunction although officials were angry the residents were not and jackson was surrounded by crowds of enthusiastic onlookers during filming one woman managed to push through security to hug jackson who continued dancing while hugging her another woman appeared and hugged him from behind he then fell to the ground as police pulled the two women off him and escorted them away after the director helped jackson get up off the street he continued to sing and dance this incident made it into the music video 1500 policemen and 50 residents acting as security guards effectively sealed off the dona marta favela some residents and officials found it offensive that jackson s production team had negotiated with drug dealers in order to gain permission to film in one of the city s shantytowns the music video was directed by spike lee asked why he chose lee to direct the video jackson responded they do nt care about us has an edge and spike lee had approached me it s a public awareness song and that s what he is all about it s a protest kind of song and i think he was perfect for it jackson also collaborated with 200 members of the cultural group olodum who swayed to the heavy beat of salvador s samba reggae music the media interest surrounding the music video exposed olodum to 140 countries around the world it brought them worldwide fame and increased their credibility in brazil at the beginning of the video a brazilian woman says michael eles n\u00e3o ligam pra gente which means michael they do nt care about us precarious houses in the favela of complexo do alem\u00e3o in rio de janeiro identical scenes are viewable in the first music video speaking of the music video in the new brazilian cinema l\u00facia nagib observed when michael jackson decided to shoot his new music video in a favela of rio de janeiro he used the favela people as extras in a visual superspectacle all the while there is a vaguely political appeal in there the interesting aspect of michael jackson s strategy is the efficiency with which it gives visibility to poverty and social problems in countries like brazil without resorting to traditional political discourse the problematic aspect is that it does not entail a real intervention in that poverty in 2009 billboard described the area as now a model for social development and claimed that jackson s influence was partially responsible for this improvement for the first time in his career jackson made a second music video for a single this second version was filmed in a prison with cell mates in the video jackson is seen handcuffed it also contains real footage of police attacking african americans the military crackdown of the protest in the tiananmen square the ku klux klan war crimes

producer of manhattan connection live performances edit they do nt care about us was only performed as part of the opening medley for the history world tour along with scream and in the closet the segment for they do nt care about us began with a short military style dance sequence and contained an excerpt of history a short unedited video clip released after jackson s death of the june 23 2009 rehearsal for the this is it concert series shows jackson performing the song as the main song in a medley with parts of history song as well as why you wanna trip on me and she drives me wild from dangerous the song was later remixed and featured as part of cirque du soleil s michael jackson the immortal world tour lyric dispute and context edit the new york times reported the song contained racist and antisemitic content on june 15 1995 just a day before the album s release the publication highlighted the lyrics jew me sue me everybody do me kick me kike me do nt you black or white me jackson responded directly to the publication stating the idea that these lyrics could be deemed objectionable is extremely hurtful to me and misleading the song in fact is about the pain of prejudice and hate and is a way to draw attention to social and political problems i am the voice of the accused and the attacked i am the voice of everyone i am the skinhead i am the jew i am the black man i am the white man i am not the one who was attacking it is about the injustices to young people and how the system can wrongfully accuse them i am angry and outraged that i could be so misinterpreted michael jackson when questioned further about the lyrics on the abc news program prime time live jackson stated it s not antisemitic because i m not a racist person i could never be a racist i love all races the singer also claimed that some of his closest employees and friends were jewish that same day jackson received support from his manager and record label who described the lyrics as brilliant that they were about opposition to prejudice and taken out of context the following day two leading members of the jewish community stated that jackson s attempt to make a song critical of discrimination had backfired they expressed the opinion that the lyrics used were unsuitable for a teenage audience that might not understand the song s context adding that the song was too ambiguous for some listeners to understand they accepted that jackson meant well and suggested that the entertainer write an explanation in the album booklet on june 17 jackson issued another public apology for his choice of words he promised that future copies of the album would include an apology by this point however two million copies of the record had already been shipped the singer concluded i just want you all to know how strongly i am committed to tolerance peace and love and i apologize to anyone who might have been hurt the next day in his review of history jon pareles of the new york times alleged in they do nt care about us he gives the lie to his entire catalogue of brotherhood anthems with a burst of antisemitism on june 21 patrick macdonald of the seattle times criticized jackson stating he may have lived a sheltered life but there really is no excuse for using terms like jew me and kike in a pop song unless you make it clear you are denouncing such terms and do so in an artful way two days later jackson decided despite the cost incurred he would return to the studio and alter the offending wording on future copies of the album jew me and kike me would be substituted with do me and strike me the music video and some copies of the album still carry the original words but with loud abstract noises partially drowning them out he reiterated his acceptance that the song was offensive to some spike lee claimed there was some kind of double standard in the music industry while the new york times asserted the use of racial slurs in they do nt care about us they were silent on other racial slurs in the album the notorious big says nigga on this time around another song on the history album but it did not attract media attention as well as many years before

bibliography 13 external links background edit page from the original manuscript copy of alice s adventures under ground 1864 alice was published in 1865 three years after charles lutwidge dodgson and the reverend robinson duckworth rowed in a boat on 4 july 1862 this popular date of the golden afternoon might be a confusion or even another alice tale for that particular day was cool cloudy and rainy up the isis with the three young daughters of henry liddell the vicechancellor of oxford university and dean of christ church lorina charlotte liddell aged 13 born 1849 prima in the book s prefatory verse alice pleasance liddell aged 10 born 1852 secunda in the prefatory verse edith mary liddell aged 8 born 1853 tertia in the prefatory verse the journey began at folly bridge near oxford and ended five miles away in the village of godstow during the trip the reverend dodgson told the girls a story that featured a bored little girl named alice who goes looking for an adventure the girls loved it and alice liddell asked dodgson to write it down for her he began writing the manuscript of the story the next day although that earliest version no longer exists the girls and dodgson took another boat trip a month later when he elaborated the plot to the story of alice and in november he began working on the manuscript in earnest to add the finishing touches he researched natural history for the animals presented in the book and then had the book examined by other children particularly the children of george macdonald he added his own illustrations but approached john tenniel to illustrate the book for publication telling him that the story had been well liked by children on 26 november 1864 he gave alice the handwritten manuscript of alice s adventures under ground with illustrations by dodgson himself dedicating it as a christmas gift to a dear child in memory of a summer s day some including martin gardner speculate there was an earlier version that was destroyed later by dodgson when he wrote a more elaborate copy by hand but before alice received her copy dodgson was already preparing it for publication and expanding the 15500 word original to 27500 words most notably adding the episodes about the cheshire cat and the mad tea party synopsis edit the white rabbit chapter one down the rabbit hole alice a girl of seven years is feeling bored and drowsy while sitting on the riverbank with her elder sister she then notices a talking clothed white rabbit with a pocket watch run past she follows it down a rabbit hole when suddenly she falls a long way to a curious hall with many locked doors of all sizes she finds a small key to a door too small for her to fit through but through it she sees an attractive garden she then discovers a bottle on a table labelled drink me the contents of which cause her to shrink too small to reach the key which she has left on the table she eats a cake with eat me written on it in currants as the chapter closes chapter two the pool of tears chapter two opens with alice growing to such a tremendous size her head hits the ceiling alice is unhappy and as she cries her tears flood the hallway after shrinking down again due to a fan she had picked up alice swims through her own tears and meets a mouse who is swimming as well she tries to make small talk with him in elementary french thinking he may be a french mouse but her opening gambit o\u00f9 est ma chatte where is my cat offends the mouse and he tries to escape her chapter three the caucus race and a long tale the sea of tears becomes crowded with other animals and birds that have been swept away by the rising waters alice and the other animals convene on the bank and the question among them is how to get dry again the mouse gives them a very dry lecture on william the conqueror a dodo decides that the best thing to dry them off would be a caucus race which consists of everyone running in a circle with no clear winner alice eventually frightens all the animals away unwittingly by talking about her moderately ferocious cat chapter four the rabbit sends a little bill the white rabbit appears again in search of the duchess s gloves and fan mistaking her for his maidservant mary ann he orders alice to go into the house and retrieve them but once she gets inside she starts growing the horrified rabbit orders his gardener bill the lizard to climb on the roof and go down the chimney outside alice hears the voices of animals that have gathered to gawk at her giant arm the crowd hurls pebbles at her which turn into little cakes alice eats them and they reduce her again in size chapter five advice from a caterpillar alice comes upon a mushroom and sitting on it is a blue caterpillar smoking a hookah the caterpillar questions alice and she admits to her current identity crisis compounded by her inability to remember a poem before crawling away the caterpillar tells alice that one side of the mushroom will make her taller and the other side will make her shorter she breaks off two pieces from the mushroom one side makes her shrink smaller than ever while another causes her neck to grow high into the trees where a pigeon mistakes her for a serpent with some effort alice brings herself back to her normal height she stumbles upon a small estate and uses the mushroom to reach a more appropriate height the cheshire cat chapter six pig and pepper a fish footman has an invitation for the duchess of the house which he delivers to a frog footman alice observes this transaction and after a perplexing conversation with the frog lets herself into the house the duchess s cook is throwing dishes and making a soup that has too much pepper which causes alice the duchess and her baby but not the cook or grinning cheshire cat to sneeze violently alice is given the baby by the duchess and to her surprise the baby turns into a pig the cheshire cat appears in a tree directing her to the march hare s house he disappears but his grin remains behind to float on its own in the air prompting alice to remark that she has often seen a cat without a grin but never a grin without a cat chapter seven a mad tea party alice becomes a guest at a mad tea party along with the march hare the hatter and a very tired dormouse who falls asleep frequently only to be violently woken up moments later by the march hare and the hatter the characters give alice many riddles and stories including the famous why is a raven like a writing desk the hatter reveals that they have tea all day because time has punished him by eternally standing still at 6 pm tea time alice becomes insulted and tired of being bombarded with riddles and she leaves claiming that it was the stupidest tea party that she had ever been to alice trying to play croquet with a flamingo chapter eight the queen s croquet ground alice leaves the tea party and enters the garden where she comes upon three living playing cards painting the white roses on a rose tree red because the queen of hearts hates white roses a procession of more cards kings and queens and even the white rabbit enters the garden alice then meets the king and queen the queen a figure difficult to please introduces her trademark phrase off with his head which she utters at the slightest dissatisfaction with a subject alice is invited or some might say ordered to play a game of croquet with the queen and the rest of her subjects but the game quickly descends into chaos live flamingos are used as mallets and hedgehogs as balls and alice once again meets the cheshire cat the queen of hearts then orders the cat to be beheaded only to have her executioner complain that this is impossible since the head is all that can be seen of him because the cat belongs to the duchess the queen is prompted to release the duchess from prison to resolve the matter chapter nine the mock turtle s story the duchess is brought to the croquet ground at alice s request she ruminates on finding morals in everything around her the queen of hearts dismisses her on the threat of execution and she introduces alice to the gryphon who takes her to the mock turtle the mock turtle is very sad even though he has no sorrow he tries to tell his story about how he used to be a real turtle in school which the gryphon interrupts so they can play a game chapter ten lobster quadrille the mock turtle and the gryphon dance to the lobster quadrille while alice recites rather incorrectly tis the voice of the lobster the mock turtle sings them beautiful soup during which the gryphon drags alice away for an impending trial chapter eleven who stole the tarts alice attends a trial whereby the knave of hearts is accused of stealing the queen s tarts the jury is composed of various animals including bill the lizard the white rabbit is the court s trumpeter and the judge is the king of hearts during the proceedings alice finds that she is steadily growing larger the dormouse scolds alice and tells her she has no right to grow at such a rapid pace and take up all the air alice scoffs and calls the dormouse s accusation ridiculous because everyone grows and she can not help it meanwhile witnesses at the trial include the hatter who displeases and frustrates the king through his indirect answers to the questioning and the duchess s cook chapter twelve alice s evidence alice is then called up as a witness she accidentally knocks over the jury box with the animals inside them and the king orders the animals be placed back into their seats before the trial continues the king and queen order alice to be gone citing rule 42 all persons more than a mile high to leave the court but alice disputes their judgement and refuses to leave she argues with the king and queen of hearts over the ridiculous proceedings eventually refusing to hold her tongue the queen shouts her familiar off with her head but alice is unafraid calling them out as just a pack of cards just as they start to swarm over her alice s sister wakes her up from a dream brushing what turns out to be some leaves and not a shower of playing cards from alice s face alice leaves her sister on the bank to imagine all the curious happenings for herself characters edit jessie willcox smith s illustration of alice surrounded by the characters of wonderland 1923 further information list of minor characters in the alice series the following is a list of main characters in alice s adventures in wonderland alice the white rabbit the mouse the dodo the lory the eaglet the duck pat bill the lizard puppy the caterpillar the duchess the cheshire cat the march hare the hatter the dormouse the queen of hearts the knave of hearts the king of hearts the gryphon the mock turtle character allusions edit mad tea party theophilus carter has been suggested as a model for the hatter in the annotated alice martin gardner provides background information for the characters the members of the boating party that first heard carroll s tale show up in chapter 3 a caucus race and a long tale alice liddell herself is there while carroll is caricatured as the dodo because dodgson stuttered when he spoke he sometimes pronounced his last name as dodo dodgson the duck refers to canon duckworth and the lory and eaglet to alice liddell s sisters lorina and edith bill the lizard may be a play on the name of british prime minister benjamin disraeli one of tenniel s illustrations in through the looking glass the 1871 sequel to alice depicts the character referred to as the man in white paper whom alice meets as a fellow passenger riding on the train with her as a caricature of disraeli wearing a paper hat the illustrations of the lion and the unicorn also in looking glass also bear a striking resemblance to tenniel s punch illustrations of gladstone and disraeli it has been suggested by some writers that the hatter is a reference to theophilus carter a furniture dealer known in oxford tenniel apparently drew the hatter to resemble carter on a suggestion of carroll s however it is unlikely that carter was the model for the hatter and there is no evidence that carroll ever invited tenniel to oxford for any purpose the dormouse tells a story about three little sisters named elsie lacie and tillie these are the liddell sisters elsie is lc lorina charlotte tillie is edith her family nickname is matilda and lacie is an anagram of alice the mock turtle speaks of a drawling master an old conger eel who came once a week to teach drawling stretching and fainting in coils this is a reference to the art critic john ruskin who came once a week to the liddell house to teach the children drawing sketching and painting in oils the children did in fact learn well alice liddell for one produced a number of skilful watercolours the mock turtle also sings turtle soup this is a parody of a song called star of the evening beautiful star which was performed as a trio by lorina alice and edith liddell for lewis carroll in the liddell home during the same summer in which he first told the story of alice s adventures under ground poems and songs edit carroll wrote multiple poems and songs for alice s adventures in wonderland including all in the golden afternoon the prefatory verse an original poem by carroll that recalls the rowing expedition on which he first told the story of alice s adventures underground how doth the little crocodile a parody of isaac watts nursery rhyme against idleness and mischief the mouse s tale an example of concrete poetry you are old father william a parody of robert southey s the old man s comforts and how he gained them the duchess s lullaby speak roughly to your little boy a parody of david bates speak gently twinkle twinkle little bat a parody of jane taylor s twinkle twinkle little star the lobster quadrille a parody of mary botham howitt s the spider and the fly tis the voice of the lobster a parody of isaac watts the sluggard beautiful soup a parody of james m sayles s star of the evening beautiful star the queen of hearts an actual nursery rhyme they told me you had been to her the white rabbit s evidence writing style and themes edit symbolism edit martin gardner and other scholars have shown the book to be filled with many parodies of victorian popular culture suggesting it belongs in spirit with gilbert sullivan s topsyturveydom most of the book s adventures may have been based on and influenced by people situations and buildings in oxford and at christ church eg the rabbit hole which symbolised the actual stairs in the back of the main hall in christ church a carving of a griffon and rabbit as seen in ripon cathedral where carroll s father was a canon may have provided inspiration for the tale since carroll was a mathematician at christ church it has been suggested that there are many references and mathematical concepts in both this story and through the looking glass examples include in chapter 1 down the rabbit hole in the midst of shrinking alice waxes philosophic concerning what final size she will end up as perhaps going out altogether like a candle this pondering reflects the concept of a limit in chapter 2 the pool of tears alice tries to perform multiplication but produces some odd results let me see four times five is twelve and four times six is thirteen and four times seven is oh dear i shall never get to twenty at that rate this explores the representation of numbers using different bases and positional numeral systems 4 \u00d7 5 12 in base 18 notation 4 \u00d7 6 13 in base 21 notation and 4 \u00d7 7 could be 14 in base 24 notation continuing this sequence going up three bases each time the result will continue to be less than 20 in the corresponding base notation after 4 \u00d7 12 19 in base 39 the product would be 4 \u00d7 13 1a in base 42 then 1b 1c 1d and so on in chapter 7 a mad tea party the march hare the hatter and the dormouse give several examples in which the semantic value of a sentence a is not the same value of the converse of a for example why you might just as well say that i see what i eat is the same thing as i eat what i see in logic and mathematics this is discussing an inverse relationship also in chapter 7 alice ponders what it means when the changing of seats around the circular table places them back at the beginning this is an observation of addition on the ring of integers modulo n the cheshire cat fades until it disappears entirely leaving only its wide grin suspended in the air leading alice to marvel and note that she has seen a cat without a grin but never a grin without a cat deep abstraction of concepts such as noneuclidean geometry abstract algebra and the beginnings of mathematical logic was taking over mathematics at the time dodgson was writing dodgson s delineation of the relationship between cat and grin can be taken to represent the very concept of mathematics and number itself for example instead of considering two or three apples one may easily consider the concept of apple upon which the concepts of two and three may seem to depend a far more sophisticated jump is to consider the concepts of two and three by themselves just like a grin originally seemingly dependent on the cat separated conceptually from its physical object literary scholar melanie bayley asserted in the magazine new scientist that dodgson wrote alice in wonderland in its final form as a scathing satire on new modern mathematics that were emerging in the mid19th century it has been suggested by several people including martin gardner and selwyn goodacre that dodgson had an interest in the french language choosing to make references and puns about it in the story it is most likely that these are references to french lessons a common feature of a victorian middle class girl s upbringing for example in the second chapter alice posits that the mouse may be french she therefore chooses to speak the first sentence of her french lesson book to it o\u00f9 est ma chatte where is my cat in henri bu\u00e9 s french translation alice posits that the mouse may be italian and speaks italian to it pat s digging for apples could be a crosslanguage pun as pomme de terre literally apple of the earth means potato and pomme means apple which little english girls studying french would easily guess in the second chapter alice initially addresses the mouse as o mouse based on her memory of the noun declensions in her brother s latin grammar a mouse of a mouse to a mouse a mouse o mouse these words correspond to the first five of latin s six cases in a traditional order established by medieval grammarians mus nominative muris genitive muri dative murem accusative o mus vocative the sixth case mure ablative is absent from alice s recitation in the eighth chapter three cards are painting the roses on a rose tree red because they had accidentally planted a white rose tree that the queen of hearts hates red roses symbolised the english house of lancaster while white roses were the symbol for their rival house of york this scene is an allusion to the wars of the roses while the book has remained in print and continually inspires new adaptations the cultural material that it references has become largely specialized knowledge dr leon coward asserts the book suffers from readings which reflect today s fascination with postmodernism and psychology rather than delving into an historically informed interpretation and speculates that this has been partly driven by audiences encountering the narrative through a second hand source explaining our impressions of the original text are based on a multiplicity of reinterpretations we do nt necessarily realise we re missing anything in understanding the original product because we re usually never dealing with the original product eating and devouring edit carina garland notes how the world is expressed via representations of food and appetite naming alice s frequent desire for consumption of both food and words her curious appetites often the idea of eating coincides to make gruesome images after the riddle why is a raven like a writing desk the hatter claims that alice might as well say i see what i eat i eat what i see and so the riddle s solution put forward by boe birns could be that a raven eats worms a writing desk is worm eaten this idea of food encapsulates idea of life feeding on life for the worm is being eaten and then becomes the eater a horrific image of mortality nina auerbach discusses how the novel revolves around eating and drinking which motivates much of her alice s behaviour for the story is essentially about things entering and leaving her mouth the animals of wonderland are of particular interest for alice s relation to them shifts constantly because as lovell smith states alice s changes in size continually reposition her in the food chain serving as a way to make her acutely aware of the eat or be eaten attitude that permeates wonderland illustrations edit one of the author s own illustrations the manuscript was illustrated by dodgson himself who added 37 illustrations printed in a facsimile edition in 1887 john tenniel provided 42 wood engraved illustrations for the published version of the book the first print run was destroyed or sold to america at carroll s request because he was dissatisfied with the quality the book was reprinted and published in 1866 john tenniel s illustrations of alice do not portray the real alice liddell who had dark hair and a short fringe alice has provided a challenge for other illustrators including those of 1907 by charles pears and the full series of colour plates and line drawings by harry rountree published in the interwar children s press glasgow edition other significant illustrators include arthur rackham 1907 willy pogany 1929 mervyn peake 1946 ralph steadman 1967 salvador dal\u00ed 1969 graham overden 1969 max ernst 1970 peter blake 1970 tove jansson 1977 anthony browne 1988 helen oxenbury 1999 and lisbeth zwerger 1999 reception by reviewers edit the book alice in wonderland failed to be named in an 1888 poll of the most popular children s stories generally it received poor reviews with reviewers giving more credit to tenniel s illustrations than to carroll s story at the release of through the looking glass the first alice tale gained in popularity and by the end of the 19th century sir walter besant wrote that alice in wonderland was a book of that extremely rare kind which will belong to all the generations to come until the language becomes obsolete publication history edit title page of the original edition 1865 in 1865 dodgson s tale was published as alice s adventures in wonderland by lewis carroll with illustrations by john tenniel the first print run of 2000 was held back because tenniel objected to the print quality a new edition released in december of the same year but carrying an 1866 date was quickly printed the text blocks of the original edition were removed from the binding and sold with dodgson s permission to the new york publishing house of d appleton company the binding for the appleton alice was virtually identical to the 1866 macmillan alice except for the publisher s name at the foot of the spine the title page of the appleton alice was an insert cancelling the original macmillan title page of 1865 and bearing the new york publisher s imprint and the date 1866 the entire print run sold out quickly alice was a publishing sensation beloved by children and adults alike among its first avid readers were queen victoria and the young oscar wilde the book has never been out of print alice s adventures in wonderland has been translated into at least 97 languages or as many as 174 languages there have now been over a hundred editions of the book as well as countless adaptations in other media especially theatre and film the book is commonly referred to by the abbreviated title alice in wonderland which has been popularised by the numerous stage film and television adaptations of the story

with her in mind promising it to rimes no matter what walt disney pictures the parent company of touchstone pictures decided that rimes recording had too much of a pop feel to it and because she was 14 that she was too young for the subject matter expressed in the song trisha yearwood was ultimately chosen to rerecord the song utilizing a more throaty country western vibe yearwood s version was released on may 27 1997 to country radio and appeared in the film according to yearwood she had no idea of rimes recording prior to being approached by touchstone pictures to do the song when wilbur rimes leann s father and then manager heard of the release her version was quickly released to mainstream pop radio neither rimes nor yearwood s version of the song was included on the soundtrack album for the film which consists of the score by trevor rabin and mark mancina rimes version was released on a cd and cassette tape single with the original rendition of the song plus an extended

saved manchester united because he made two or three great saves but unfortunately that s a waste of time he played well yesterday but playing well for 92 and ahalf minutes and then doing that in the

ganga was requested to descend to earth to help suffering humanity on the request of suryavansh king bhagiratha the earth was unable to withstand the force of her descent therefore the mighty ganga ganges was split into two holy channels with alaknanda one of them another legend explains both name and sitting posture as this place was full of badri bushes and vishnu meditating for beloved lakshmi stood next to him sheltering him from scorching sunlight turned into a badri herself called badri vishal and her lord nath became the badrinath the mountains around badrinath are mentioned in

sweetened carbonated soft drink made from ingredients that contain caffeine from the kola nut and noncocaine derivatives from coca leaves flavored with vanilla and other ingredients most colas now use other flavoring and caffeinating ingredients with a similar taste colas became popular worldwide after pharmacist john pemberton invented coca cola in 1886 his nonalcoholic recipe was inspired by the coca wine of pharmacist angelo mariani created in 1863 modern colas usually contain caramel color caffeine and sweeteners such as sugar or high fructose corn syrup they now come in numerous different brands among them the most popular are coca cola and pepsi cola these two cola companies have been rivaling each other since the 1980s contents hide 1 flavorings 2 clear cola 3 health effects 4

sugar citrus oils from oranges limes or lemon fruit peel cinnamon vanilla and an acidic flavorant manufacturers of cola drinks add trace ingredients to create distinctively different tastes for each brand trace flavorings may include nutmeg and a wide variety of ingredients but the base flavorings that most people identify with a cola taste remain vanilla and cinnamon acidity is often provided by phosphoric acid sometimes accompanied by citric or other isolated acids coca cola s recipe is maintained as a corporate trade secret a variety of different sweeteners may be added to cola often partly dependent on local agricultural policy high fructose corn syrup hfcs is predominantly used in the united states and canada due to the lower cost of government subsidized corn in europe however hfcs is subject to production quotas designed to encourage the production of sugar sugar is thus typically used to sweeten sodas in addition stevia or an artificial sweetener may be used sugar free or diet colas typically contain artificial sweeteners only cola can be manufactured with sugar as in mexican coca cola kosher for passover coca cola sold in the us around the jewish holiday also uses sucrose rather than hfcs and is also highly sought after by people who prefer the original taste in addition pepsico has recently been marketing versions of its pepsi and mountain dew sodas that are sweetened with sugar instead of hfcs these are marketed under the name throwback and became permanent products clear cola edit crystal pepsi 20 oz bottle as seen in the us in 2016 in the 1940s coca cola

up ice cola crystal pepsi has been repeatedly reintroduced in the 2010s in denmark a popular clear cola was made by the cooperative fdb in 1976 it was especially known for being the hippie cola because of the focus of the harmful effects the colour additive could have on children and the boycott of multinational brands it was inspired by a campaign on harmful additives in denmark by the environmental organisation noah an independent danish division of friends of the earth this was followed up with a variete of sodas without artificial clouring today many organic colas are available in denmark but for nostalgic reasons the cola still has remained its popularity to a certain degree health effects edit further information criticism of coca cola \u00a7 health effects a 2007 study found that consumption of colas both those with natural sweetening and those with artificial sweetening was associated with increased risk of chronic kidney disease the phosphoric acid used in colas was thought to be a possible cause studies indicate soda and sweetened drinks are the main source of calories in the american diet so most nutritionists advise that coca cola and other soft drinks can be harmful if consumed excessively particularly to young children whose soft drink consumption competes with rather than complements a balanced diet studies have shown that regular soft drink users have a lower intake of calcium magnesium ascorbic acid riboflavin and vitamin a the drink has also aroused criticism for its use of caffeine which can cause physical dependence caffeine addiction a link has been shown between long term regular cola intake and osteoporosis in older women but not men this was thought to be due to the presence of phosphoric acid and the risk was found to be the same for caffeinated and noncaffeinated colas as well as the same for diet and sugared colas many soft drinks are sweetened mostly or entirely with high fructose corn syrup rather than sugar some nutritionists caution against consumption of corn syrup because it may aggravate obesity and type 2 diabetes more than cane sugar regional brands edit see also cola brands shown below and category

of the oldest academic disciplines and through its inclusion of astronomy perhaps the oldest over the last two millennia physics chemistry biology and certain branches of mathematics were a part of natural philosophy but during the scientific revolution in the 17th century these natural sciences emerged as unique research endeavors in their own right physics intersects with many interdisciplinary areas of research such as biophysics and quantum chemistry and the boundaries of physics are not rigidly defined new ideas in physics often explain the fundamental mechanisms studied by other sciences and suggest new avenues of research in academic disciplines such as mathematics and philosophy advances in physics often enable advances in new technologies for example advances in

ceiling of senemut s tomb from the eighteenth dynasty of egypt astronomy is one of the oldest natural sciences early civilizations dating back to beyond 3000 bce such as the sumerians ancient egyptians and the indus valley civilization had a predictive knowledge and a basic understanding of the motions of the sun moon and stars the stars and planets were often worshipped believed to represent gods while the explanations for the observed positions of the stars were often unscientific and lacking in evidence these early observations laid the foundation for later astronomy as the stars were found to traverse great circles across the sky which however did not explain the positions of the planets according to asger aaboe the origins of western astronomy can be found in mesopotamia and all western efforts in the exact sciences are descended from late babylonian astronomy egyptian astronomers left monuments showing knowledge of the constellations and the motions of the celestial bodies while greek poet homer wrote of various celestial objects in his iliad and odyssey later greek astronomers provided names which are still used today for most constellations visible from the northern hemisphere natural philosophy main article natural philosophy natural philosophy has its origins in greece during the archaic period 650 bce 480 bce when presocratic philosophers like thales rejected nonnaturalistic explanations for natural phenomena and proclaimed that every event had a natural cause they proposed ideas verified by reason and observation and many of their hypotheses proved successful in experiment for example atomism was found to be correct approximately 2000 years after it was proposed by leucippus and his pupil democritus physics in the medieval european and islamic world main article european science in the middle ages main article physics in the medieval islamic world the basic way a pinhole camera works the western roman empire fell in the fifth century and this resulted in a decline in intellectual pursuits in the western part of europe by contrast the eastern roman empire also known as the byzantine empire resisted the attacks from the barbarians and continued to advance various fields of learning including physics in the sixth century isidore of miletus created an important compilation of archimedes works that are copied in the archimedes palimpsest in sixth century europe john philoponus a byzantine scholar questioned aristotle s teaching of physics and noting its flaws he introduced the theory of impetus aristotle s physics was not scrutinized until john philoponus appeared and unlike aristotle who based his physics on verbal argument philoponus relied on observation on aristotle s physics john philoponus wrote but this is completely erroneous and our view may be corroborated by actual observation more effectively than by any sort of verbal argument for if you let fall from the same height two weights of which one is many times as heavy as the other you will see that the ratio of the times required for the motion does not depend on the ratio of the weights but that the difference in time is a very small one and so if the difference in the weights is not considerable that is of one is let us say double the other there will be no difference or else an imperceptible difference in time though the difference in weight is by no means negligible with one body weighing twice as much as the other john philoponus criticism of aristotelian principles of physics served as an inspiration for galileo galilei ten centuries later during the scientific revolution galileo cited philoponus substantially in his works when arguing that aristotelian physics was flawed in the 1300s jean buridan a teacher in the faculty of arts at the university of paris developed the concept of impetus it was a step toward the modern ideas of inertia and momentum islamic scholarship inherited aristotelian physics from the greeks and during the islamic golden age developed it further especially placing emphasis on observation and a priori reasoning developing early forms of the scientific method the most notable innovations were in the field of optics and vision which came from the works of many scientists like ibn sahl al kindi ibn al haytham al farisi and avicenna the most notable work was the book of optics also known as kit\u0101b al man\u0101\u1e93ir written by ibn al haytham in which he conclusively disproved the ancient greek idea about vision but also came up with a new theory in the book he presented a study of the phenomenon of the camera obscura his thousand year old version of the pinhole camera and delved further into the way the eye itself works using dissections and the knowledge of previous scholars he was able to begin to explain how light enters the eye he asserted that the light ray is focused but the actual explanation of how light projected to the back of the eye had to wait until 1604 his treatise on light explained the camera obscura hundreds of years before the modern development of photography ibn al haytham c 965 c 1040 book of optics book i 685 686 book ii 380 describes his camera obscura experiments the seven volume book of optics kitab al manathir hugely influenced thinking across disciplines from the theory of visual perception to the nature of perspective in medieval art in both the east and the west for more than 600 years many later european scholars and fellow polymaths from robert grosseteste and leonardo da vinci to ren\u00e9 descartes johannes kepler and isaac newton were in his debt indeed the influence of ibn al haytham s optics ranks alongside that of newton s work of the same title published 700 years later the translation of the book of optics had a huge impact on europe from it later european scholars were able to build devices that replicated those ibn al haytham had built and understand the way light works from this such important things as eyeglasses magnifying glasses telescopes and cameras were developed classical physics main article classical physics sir isaac newton 1643 1727 whose laws of motion and universal gravitation were major milestones in classical physics physics became a separate science when early modern europeans used experimental and quantitative methods to discover what are now considered to be the laws of physics major developments in this period include the replacement of the geocentric model of the solar system with the heliocentric copernican model the laws governing the motion of planetary bodies determined by johannes kepler between 1609 and 1619 pioneering work on telescopes and observational astronomy by galileo galilei in the 16th and 17th centuries and isaac newton s discovery and unification of the laws of motion and universal gravitation that would come to bear his name newton also developed calculus the mathematical study of change which provided new mathematical methods for solving physical problems the discovery of new laws in thermodynamics chemistry and electromagnetics resulted from greater research efforts during the industrial revolution as energy needs increased the laws comprising classical physics remain very widely used for objects on everyday scales travelling at nonrelativistic speeds since they provide a very close approximation in such situations and theories such as quantum mechanics and the theory of relativity simplify to their classical equivalents at such scales however inaccuracies in classical mechanics for very small objects and very high velocities led to the development of modern physics in the 20th century modern physics main article modern physics see also history of special relativity and history of quantum mechanics max planck 1858 1947 the originator of the theory of quantum mechanics albert einstein 1879 1955 whose work on the photoelectric effect and the theory of relativity led to a revolution in 20th century physics modern physics began in the early 20th century with the work of max planck in quantum theory and albert einstein s theory of relativity both of these theories came about due to inaccuracies in classical mechanics in certain situations classical mechanics predicted a varying speed of light which could not be resolved with the constant speed predicted by maxwell s equations of electromagnetism this discrepancy was corrected by einstein s theory of special relativity which replaced classical mechanics for fast moving bodies and allowed for a constant speed of light black body radiation provided another problem for classical physics which was corrected when planck proposed that the excitation of material oscillators is possible only in discrete steps proportional to their frequency this along with the photoelectric effect and a complete theory predicting discrete energy levels of electron orbitals led to the theory of quantum mechanics taking over from classical physics at very small scales quantum mechanics would come to be pioneered by werner heisenberg erwin schr\u00f6dinger and paul dirac from this early work and work in related fields the standard model of particle physics was derived following the discovery of a particle with properties consistent with the higgs boson at cern in 2012 all fundamental particles predicted by the standard model and no others appear to exist however physics beyond the standard model with theories such as supersymmetry is an active area of research areas of mathematics in general are important to this field such as the study of probabilities and groups philosophy main article philosophy of physics in many ways physics stems from ancient greek philosophy from thales first attempt to characterise matter to democritus deduction that matter ought to reduce to an invariant state the ptolemaic astronomy of a crystalline firmament and aristotle s book physics an early book on physics which attempted to analyze and define motion from a philosophical point of view various greek philosophers advanced their own theories of nature physics was known as natural philosophy until the late 18th century by the 19th century physics was realised as a discipline distinct from philosophy and the other sciences physics as with the rest of science relies on philosophy of science and its scientific method to advance our knowledge of the physical world the scientific method employs a priori reasoning as well as a posteriori reasoning and the use of bayesian inference to measure the validity of a given theory the development of physics has answered many questions of early philosophers but has also raised new questions study of the philosophical issues surrounding physics the philosophy of physics involves issues such as the nature of space and time determinism and metaphysical outlooks such as empiricism naturalism and realism many physicists have written about the philosophical implications of their work for instance laplace who championed causal determinism and erwin schr\u00f6dinger who wrote on quantum mechanics the mathematical physicist roger penrose has been called a platonist by stephen hawking a view penrose discusses in his book the road to reality hawking refers to himself as an unashamed reductionist and takes issue with penrose s views core theories further information branches of physics and outline of physics though physics deals with a wide variety of systems certain theories are used by all physicists each of these theories were experimentally tested numerous times and found to be an adequate approximation of nature for instance the theory of classical mechanics accurately describes the motion of objects provided they are much larger than atoms and moving at much less than the speed of light these theories continue to be areas of active research today chaos theory a remarkable aspect of classical mechanics was discovered in the 20th century three centuries after the original formulation of classical mechanics by isaac newton 1642 1727 these central theories are important tools for research into more specialised topics and any physicist regardless of their specialisation is expected to be literate in them these include classical mechanics quantum mechanics thermodynamics and statistical mechanics electromagnetism and special relativity classical physics main article classical physics classical physics implemented in an acoustic engineering model of sound reflecting from an acoustic diffuser classical physics includes the traditional branches and topics that were recognised and well developed before the beginning of the 20th century classical mechanics acoustics optics thermodynamics and electromagnetism classical mechanics is concerned with bodies acted on by forces and bodies in motion and may be divided into statics study of the forces on a body or bodies not subject to an acceleration kinematics study of motion without regard to its causes and dynamics study of motion and the forces that affect it mechanics may also be divided into solid mechanics and fluid mechanics known together as continuum mechanics the latter include such branches as hydrostatics hydrodynamics aerodynamics and pneumatics acoustics is the study of how sound is produced controlled transmitted and received important modern branches of acoustics include ultrasonics the study of sound waves of very high frequency beyond the range of human hearing bioacoustics the physics of animal calls and hearing and electroacoustics the manipulation of audible sound waves using electronics optics the study of light is concerned not only with visible light but also with infrared and ultraviolet radiation which exhibit all of the phenomena of visible light except visibility eg reflection refraction interference diffraction dispersion and polarization of light heat is a form of energy the internal energy possessed by the particles of which a substance is composed thermodynamics deals with the relationships between heat and other forms of energy electricity and magnetism have been studied as a single branch of physics since the intimate connection between them was discovered in the early 19th century an electric current gives rise to a magnetic field and a changing magnetic field induces an electric current electrostatics deals with electric charges at rest electrodynamics with moving charges and magnetostatics with magnetic poles at rest modern physics main article

lawrence zeilinger solvay conference of 1927 with prominent physicists such as albert einstein werner heisenberg max planck hendrik lorentz niels bohr marie curie erwin schr\u00f6dinger and paul dirac classical physics is generally concerned with matter and energy on the normal scale of observation while much of modern physics is concerned with the behavior of matter and energy under extreme conditions or on a very large or very small scale for example atomic and nuclear physics studies matter on the smallest scale at which chemical elements can be identified the physics of elementary particles is on an even smaller scale since it is concerned with the most basic units of matter this branch of physics is also known as high energy physics because of the extremely high energies necessary to produce many types of particles in particle accelerators on this scale ordinary commonsense notions of space time matter and energy are no longer valid the two chief theories of modern physics present a different picture of the concepts of space time and matter from that presented by classical physics classical mechanics approximates nature as continuous while quantum theory is concerned with the discrete nature of many phenomena at the atomic and subatomic level and with the complementary aspects of particles and waves in the description of such phenomena the theory of relativity is concerned with the description of phenomena that take place in a frame of reference that is in motion with respect to an observer the special theory of relativity is concerned with relative uniform motion in a straight line and the general theory of relativity with accelerated motion and its connection with gravitation both quantum theory and the theory of relativity find applications in all areas of modern physics difference between classical and modern physics the basic domains of physics while physics aims to discover universal laws its theories lie in explicit domains of applicability loosely speaking the laws of classical physics accurately describe systems whose important length scales are greater than the atomic scale and whose motions are much slower than the speed of light outside of this domain observations do not match predictions provided by classical mechanics albert einstein contributed the framework of special relativity which replaced notions of absolute time and space with spacetime and allowed an accurate description of systems whose components have speeds approaching the speed of light max planck erwin schr\u00f6dinger and others introduced quantum mechanics a probabilistic notion of particles and interactions that allowed an accurate description of atomic and subatomic scales later quantum field theory unified quantum mechanics and special relativity general relativity allowed for a dynamical curved spacetime with which highly massive systems and the large scale structure of the universe can be well described general relativity has not yet been unified with the other fundamental descriptions several candidate theories of quantum gravity are being developed relation to other fields this parabola shaped lava flow illustrates the application of mathematics in physics in this case galileo s law of falling bodies mathematics and ontology are used in physics physics is used in chemistry and cosmology prerequisites mathematics provides a compact and exact language used to describe of the order in nature this was noted and advocated by pythagoras plato galileo and newton physics uses mathematics to organise and formulate experimental results from those results precise or estimated solutions quantitative results from which new predictions can be made and experimentally confirmed or negated the results from physics experiments are numerical measurements technologies based on mathematics like computation have made computational physics an active area of research the distinction between mathematics and physics is clear cut but not always obvious especially in mathematical physics ontology is a prerequisite for physics but not for mathematics it means physics is ultimately concerned with descriptions of the real world while mathematics is concerned with abstract patterns even beyond the real world thus physics statements are synthetic while mathematical statements are analytic mathematics contains hypotheses while physics contains theories mathematics statements have to be only logically true while predictions of physics statements must match observed and experimental data the distinction is clear cut but not always obvious for example mathematical physics is the application of mathematics in physics its methods are mathematical but its subject is physical the problems in this field start with a mathematical model of a physical situation system and a mathematical description of a physical law that will be applied to that system every mathematical statement used for solving has a hard to find physical meaning the final mathematical solution has an easier to find meaning because it is what the solver is looking for physics is a branch of fundamental science not practical science physics is also called the fundamental science because the subject of study of all branches of natural science like chemistry astronomy geology and biology are constrained by laws of physics similar to how chemistry is often called the central science because of its role in linking the physical sciences for example chemistry studies properties structures and reactions of matter chemistry s focus on the atomic scale distinguishes it from physics structures are formed because particles exert electrical forces on each other properties include physical characteristics of given substances and reactions are bound by laws of physics like conservation of energy mass and charge physics is applied in industries like engineering and medicine application and influence main article

particular use an applied physics curriculum usually contains a few classes in an applied discipline like geology or electrical engineering it usually differs from engineering in that an applied physicist may not be designing something in particular but rather is using physics or conducting physics research with the aim of developing new technologies or solving a problem the approach is similar to that of applied mathematics applied physicists use physics in scientific research for instance people working on accelerator physics might seek to build better particle detectors for research in theoretical physics physics is used heavily in engineering for example statics a subfield of mechanics is used in the building of bridges and other static structures the understanding and use of acoustics results in sound control and better concert halls similarly the use of optics creates better optical devices an understanding of physics makes for more realistic flight simulators video games and movies and is often critical in forensic investigations with the standard consensus that the laws of physics are universal and do not change with time physics can be used to study things that would ordinarily be mired in uncertainty for example in the study of the origin of the earth one can reasonably model earth s mass temperature and rate of rotation as a function of time allowing one to extrapolate forward or backward in time and so predict future or prior events it also allows for simulations in engineering which drastically speed up the development of a new technology but there is also considerable interdisciplinarity in the physicist s methods so many other important fields are influenced by physics eg the fields of econophysics and sociophysics research scientific method physicists use the scientific method to test the validity of a physical theory by using a methodical approach to compare the implications of a theory with the conclusions drawn from its related experiments and observations physicists are better able to test the validity of a theory in a logical unbiased and repeatable way to that end experiments are performed and observations are made in order to determine the validity or invalidity of the theory a scientific law is a concise verbal or mathematical statement of a relation which expresses a fundamental principle of some theory such as newton s law of universal gravitation theory and experiment main articles theoretical physics and experimental physics the astronaut and earth are both in free fall lightning is an electric current theorists seek to develop mathematical models that both agree with existing experiments and successfully predict future experimental results while experimentalists devise and perform experiments to test theoretical predictions and explore new phenomena although theory and experiment are developed separately they are strongly dependent upon each other progress in physics frequently comes about when experimentalists make a discovery that existing theories can not explain or when new theories generate experimentally testable predictions which inspire new experiments physicists who work at the interplay of theory and experiment are called phenomenologists who study complex phenomena observed in experiment and work to relate them to a fundamental theory theoretical physics has historically taken inspiration from philosophy electromagnetism was unified this way beyond the known universe the field of theoretical physics also deals with hypothetical issues such as parallel universes a multiverse and higher dimensions theorists invoke these ideas in hopes of solving particular problems with existing theories they then explore the consequences of these ideas and work toward making testable predictions experimental physics expands and is expanded by engineering and technology experimental physicists involved in basic research design and perform experiments with equipment such as particle accelerators and lasers whereas those involved in applied research often work in industry developing technologies such as magnetic resonance imaging mri and transistors feynman has noted that experimentalists may seek areas which are not well explored by theorists scope and aims physics involves modeling the natural world with theory usually quantitative here the path of a particle is modeled with the mathematics of calculus to explain its behavior the purview of the branch of physics known as mechanics physics covers a wide range of phenomena from elementary particles such as quarks neutrinos and electrons to the largest superclusters of galaxies included in these phenomena are the most basic objects composing all other things therefore physics is sometimes called the fundamental science physics aims to describe the various phenomena that occur in nature in terms of simpler phenomena thus physics aims to both connect the things observable to humans to root causes and then connect these causes together for example the ancient chinese observed that certain rocks lodestone and magnetite were attracted to one another by an invisible force this effect was later called magnetism which was first rigorously studied in the 17th century but even before the chinese discovered magnetism the ancient greeks knew of other objects such as amber that when rubbed with fur would cause a similar invisible attraction between the two this was also first studied rigorously in the 17th century and came to be called electricity thus physics had come to understand two observations of nature in terms of some root cause electricity and magnetism however further work in the 19th century revealed that these two forces were just two different aspects of one force electromagnetism this process of unifying forces continues today and electromagnetism and the weak nuclear force are now considered to be two aspects of the electroweak interaction physics hopes to find an ultimate reason theory of everything for why nature is as it is see section current research below for more information research fields contemporary research in physics can be broadly divided into nuclear and particle physics condensed matter physics atomic molecular and optical physics astrophysics and applied physics some physics departments also support physics education research and physics outreach since the 20th century the individual fields of physics have become increasingly specialised and today most physicists work in a single field for their entire careers universalists such as albert einstein 1879 1955 and lev landau 1908 1968 who worked in multiple fields of physics are now very rare the major fields of physics along with their subfields and the theories and concepts they employ are shown in the following table field subfields major theories concepts nuclear and particle physics nuclear physics nuclear astrophysics particle physics particle

nuclear and particle physics main articles particle physics and nuclear physics a simulated event in the cms detector of the large hadron collider featuring a possible appearance of the higgs boson particle physics is the study of the elementary constituents of matter and energy and the interactions between them in addition particle physicists design and develop the high energy accelerators detectors and computer programs necessary for this research the field is also called high energy physics because many elementary particles do not occur naturally but are created only during high energy collisions of other particles currently the interactions of elementary particles and fields are described by the standard model the model accounts for the 12 known particles of matter quarks and leptons that interact via the strong weak and electromagnetic fundamental forces dynamics are described in terms of matter particles exchanging gauge bosons gluons w and z bosons and photons respectively the standard model also predicts a particle known as the higgs boson in july 2012 cern the european laboratory for particle physics announced the detection of a particle consistent with the higgs boson an integral part of a higgs mechanism nuclear physics is the field of physics that studies the constituents and interactions of atomic nuclei the most commonly known applications of nuclear physics are nuclear power generation and nuclear weapons technology but the research has provided application in many fields including those in nuclear medicine and magnetic resonance imaging ion implantation in materials engineering and radiocarbon dating in geology and archaeology atomic molecular and optical physics main article atomic molecular and optical physics atomic molecular and optical physics amo is the study of matter matter and light matter interactions on the scale of single atoms and molecules the three areas are grouped together because of their interrelationships the similarity of methods used and the commonality of their relevant energy scales all three areas include both classical semiclassical and quantum treatments they can treat their subject from a microscopic view in contrast to a macroscopic view atomic physics studies the electron shells of atoms current research focuses on activities in quantum control cooling and trapping of atoms and ions low temperature collision dynamics and the effects of electron correlation on structure and dynamics atomic physics is influenced by the nucleus see eg hyperfine splitting but intranuclear phenomena such as fission and fusion are considered part of nuclear physics molecular physics focuses on multiatomic structures and their internal and external interactions with matter and light optical physics is distinct from optics in that it tends to focus not on the control of classical light fields by macroscopic objects but on the fundamental properties of optical fields and their interactions with matter in the microscopic realm condensed matter physics main article condensed matter physics velocity distribution data of a gas of rubidium atoms confirming the discovery of a new phase of matter the bose einstein condensate condensed matter physics is the field of physics that deals with the macroscopic physical properties of matter in particular it is concerned with the condensed phases that appear whenever the number of particles in a system is extremely large and the interactions between them are strong the most familiar examples of condensed phases are solids and liquids which arise from the bonding by way of the electromagnetic force between atoms more exotic condensed phases include the superfluid and the bose einstein condensate found in certain atomic systems at very low temperature the superconducting phase exhibited by conduction electrons in certain materials and the ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic phases of spins on atomic lattices condensed matter physics is the largest field of contemporary physics historically condensed matter physics grew out of solid state physics which is now considered one of its main subfields the term condensed matter physics was apparently coined by philip anderson when he renamed his research group previously solid state theory in 1967 in 1978 the division of solid state physics of the american physical society was renamed as the division of condensed matter physics condensed matter physics has a large overlap with chemistry materials science nanotechnology and engineering astrophysics main articles astrophysics and physical cosmology the deepest visible light image of the universe the hubble ultra deep field astrophysics and astronomy are the application of the theories and methods of physics to the study of stellar structure stellar evolution the origin of the solar system and related problems of cosmology because astrophysics is a broad subject astrophysicists typically apply many disciplines of physics including mechanics electromagnetism statistical mechanics thermodynamics quantum mechanics relativity nuclear and particle physics and atomic and molecular physics the discovery by karl jansky in 1931 that radio signals were emitted by celestial bodies initiated the science of radio astronomy most recently the frontiers of astronomy have been expanded by space exploration perturbations and interference from the earth s atmosphere make space based observations necessary for infrared ultraviolet gamma ray and xray astronomy physical cosmology is the study of the formation and evolution of the universe on its largest scales albert einstein s theory of relativity plays a central role in all modern cosmological theories in the early 20th century hubble s discovery that the universe is expanding as shown by the hubble diagram prompted rival explanations known as the steady state universe and the big bang the big bang was confirmed by the success of big bang nucleosynthesis and the discovery of the cosmic microwave background in 1964 the big bang model rests on two theoretical pillars albert einstein s general relativity and the cosmological principle cosmologists have recently established the \u03bbcdm model of the evolution of the universe which includes cosmic inflation dark energy and dark matter numerous possibilities and discoveries are anticipated to emerge from new data from the fermi gamma ray space telescope over the upcoming decade and vastly revise or clarify existing models of the universe in particular the potential for a tremendous discovery surrounding dark matter is possible over the next several years fermi will search for evidence that dark matter is composed of weakly interacting massive particles complementing similar experiments with the large hadron collider and other underground detectors ibex is already yielding new astrophysical discoveries no one knows what is creating the ena energetic neutral atoms ribbon along the termination shock of the solar wind but everyone agrees that it means the textbook picture of the heliosphere in which the solar system s enveloping pocket filled with the solar wind s charged particles is plowing

feynman a typical phenomenon described by physics a magnet levitating above a superconductor demonstrates the meissner effect research in physics is continually progressing on a large number of fronts in condensed matter physics an important unsolved theoretical problem is that of high temperature superconductivity many condensed matter experiments are aiming to fabricate workable spintronics and quantum computers in particle physics the first pieces of experimental evidence for physics beyond the standard model have begun to appear foremost among these are indications that neutrinos have nonzero mass these experimental results appear to have solved the long standing solar neutrino problem and the physics of massive neutrinos remains an area of active theoretical and experimental research the large hadron collider has already found the higgs boson but future research aims to prove or disprove the supersymmetry which extends the standard model of particle physics research on the nature of the major mysteries of dark matter and dark energy is also currently ongoing theoretical attempts to unify quantum mechanics and general relativity into a single theory of quantum gravity a program ongoing for over half a century have not yet been decisively resolved the current leading candidates are m theory superstring theory and loop quantum gravity many astronomical and cosmological phenomena have yet to be satisfactorily explained including the origin of ultrahigh energy cosmic rays the baryon asymmetry the acceleration of the universe and the anomalous rotation rates of galaxies although much progress has been made in high energy quantum and astronomical physics many everyday phenomena involving complexity chaos or turbulence are still poorly understood complex problems that seem like they could be solved by a clever application of dynamics and mechanics remain unsolved examples include the formation of sandpiles nodes in trickling water the shape of water droplets mechanisms of surface tension catastrophes and self sorting in shaken heterogeneous collections these complex phenomena have received growing attention since the 1970s for several reasons including the availability of modern mathematical methods and computers which enabled complex systems to be modeled in new ways complex physics has become part of increasingly interdisciplinary research as exemplified by the study of turbulence in aerodynamics and the observation of pattern formation in biological systems in the 1932 annual review of fluid mechanics horace lamb said i am an old man now and when i die and go to heaven there are two matters on which i hope for enlightenment one is quantum electrodynamics and the other is the turbulent motion of fluids and

torah date or range of dates most widely held by scholars book of genesis book of exodus book of leviticus book of numbers book of deuteronomy the majority of modern biblical scholars believe that the torah the books of genesis exodus leviticus numbers and deuteronomy reached its present form in the postexilic period the five books are drawn from four sources distinct schools of writers rather than individuals the priestly source the yahwist and the elohist these two are often referred to collectively as the nonpriestly source and the deuteronomist there is general agreement that the priestly source is postexilic but there is no agreement over the nonpriestly source s genesis is a postexilic work combining priestly and nonpriestly material exodus is an anthology drawn from nearly all periods of israel s history leviticus is entirely priestly and dates from the exilic postexilic period numbers is a priestly redaction ie editing of a yahwistic nonpriestly original deuteronomy now the last book of the torah began as the set of religious laws these make up the bulk of the book was extended in the early part of the 6th century to serve as the introduction to the deuteronomistic history and later still was detached from that history extended yet again and edited to conclude the torah prophets date or range of dates most widely held by scholars former prophets book of joshua book of judges books of samuel books of kings this group of books plus deuteronomy is called the deuteronomistic history by scholars the proposal that they made up a unified work was first advanced by martin noth in 1943 and has been widely accepted noth proposed that the entire history was the creation of a single individual working in the exilic period 6th century bce since then there has been wide recognition that the history appeared in two editions the first in the reign of judah s king josiah late 7th century the second during the exile 6th century noth s dating was based on the assumption that the history was completed very soon after its last recorded event the release of king jehoiachin in babylon c 560 bce but some scholars have termed his reasoning inadequate and the history may have been further extended in the postexilic period three major prophets book of isaiah book of jeremiah book of ezekiel scholars recognise three sections in the book of isaiah proto isaiah the original 8th century isaiah deutero isaiah an anonymous prophet living in babylon during the exile and trito isaiah an anonymous author or authors in jerusalem immediately after the exile the book of jeremiah exists in two versions greek the version used in orthodox christian bibles and hebrew jewish catholic and protestant bibles with the greek representing the earlier version the greek version was probably finalised in the early persian period and translated into greek in the 3rd century bce and the hebrew version dates from some point between then and the 2nd century bce the book of ezekiel describes itself as the words of the ezekiel ben buzi a priest living in exile in the city of babylon and internal evidence dates the visions to between 593 and 571 bce while the book probably reflects much of the historic ezekiel it is the product of a long and complex history with significant additions by a school of later followers twelve minor prophets in the hebrew bible the twelve minor prophets are a single collection edited in the second temple period but the collection is broken up in christian bibles with the exception of jonah which is a fictional work there exists an original core of prophetic tradition behind each book book of hosea second half of the 8th century bce book of joel late persian or hellenistic book of amos first half of the 8th century book of obadiah around the time of the fall of jerusalem 586 bce book of jonah persian or hellenistic no later than 2nd century bce book of micah c 750 700 bce book of nahum an oracle concerning nineveh the assyrian city destroyed in 612 bce book of habakkuk possibly shortly before the battle of carchemish 605 bce book of zephaniah reign of josiah book of haggai self dated to the second year of the persian king darius darius the great 520 bce book of zechariah first eight chapters contemporary with haggai chapters 9 14 from the 5th century book of malachi 5th century bce contemporaneous or immediately prior to the missions of nehemiah and ezra which however are themselves difficult to date ketuvim date or range of dates most widely held by scholars wisdom collection job ecclesiastes and proverbs the books of job ecclesiastes and proverbs share a similar outlook which they themselves call wisdom it is generally agreed that job comes from between the 7th and 4th centuries bce with the 6th century as the most likely ecclesiastes can be no earlier than about 450 bce due to the presence of persian loan words and aramaic idioms and no later than 180 bce when the jewish writer ben sira quotes from it proverbs is a collection of collections relating to a pattern of life which lasted for more than a millennium and impossible to date poetic works psalms and lamentations the psalms making up the first two thirds of the psalter are predominantly preexilic and the last third predominantly postexilic the collected book of psalms was possibly given its modern shape and division into five parts in the postexilic period although it continued to be revised and expanded well into hellenistic and even roman times it is generally accepted that the destruction of jerusalem by babylon in 586 bce forms the background to the book of lamentations histories chronicles and ezra nehemiah chronicles was composed between 400 250 bce probably in the period 350 300 bce ezra nehemiah two books in modern bibles but originally one may have reached its final form as late as the ptolemaic period c 300 200 bce miscellaneous works book of ruth book of esther book of daniel song of songs the book of ruth is commonly dated to the persian period esther to the 3rd or 4th centuries bce the book of daniel can be dated more precisely to 164 bce thanks to its veiled prophecy of the death of a greek king of syria and the song of songs could have been composed at any time after the 6th century bce table iii deuterocanonical old testament edit book date or range of dates most widely held by scholars tobit 225 175 bce on the basis of apparent use of language and references common to the postexilic period but lack of knowledge of the 2nd century bce persecution of jews judith 150 100 bce although estimates range from the 5th century bce to the 2nd century ce 1 maccabees 100 bce 2 maccabees c 100 bce 3 maccabees 100 75 bce very probable 4 maccabees mid1st century ce wisdom of solomon late 1st century bce early 1st century ce on the basis of shared outlook with other works dating from this time sirach 196 175 bce as the author implies that simon the high priest had died 196 bce but shows no knowledge of the persecution of the jews that began after 175 bce additions to daniel prayer of azariah song of the three holy children bel and the dragon late 6th century susanna and the elders possibly 95 80 bce baruch and letter of jeremiah 2nd century bce as baruch uses sirach written c 180 bce and is in turn used by the psalms of solomon mid1st century bce the letter of jeremiah ch 6 1 73 of the book of baruch is sometimes considered a separate book table iv new testament edit book date or range of dates most widely held by scholars earliest known fragment gospel of matthew 80 90 ce this is based on three strands of evidence a the setting of matthew reflects the final separation of church and synagogue about 85 ce b it reflects the capture of jerusalem and destruction of the temple by the romans in 70 ce c it uses mark usually dated around 70 ce as a source p displaystyle mathfrak p 150 200 ce gospel of mark 68 70 ce references to persecution and to war in judea suggest that its context was either nero s persecution of the christians in rome or the jewish revolt p displaystyle mathfrak p 250 ce gospel of luke 80 90 ce with some scholars suggesting 90 100 there is evidence both textual the conflicts between western and alexandrian manuscript families and from the marcionite controversy marcion was a 2nd century heretic who produced his own version of christian scripture based on luke s gospel and paul s epistles that luke acts was still being substantially revised well into the 2nd century p displaystyle mathfrak p p displaystyle mathfrak p 175 250 ce gospel of john 90 110 ce the upper date based on textual evidence that the gospel was known in the early 2nd century and the lower on an internal reference to the expulsion of christians from the synagogues p displaystyle mathfrak p 125 160 ce acts 95 100 ce if acts uses josephus as a source as has been proposed then it must have been composed after 93 ce it does not show any knowledge of paul s letters which also supports a late date and the social situation is one in which the faithful need shepherds to protect them from heretical wolves which again reflects a late date p displaystyle mathfrak p p displaystyle mathfrak p p displaystyle mathfrak p p displaystyle mathfrak p p displaystyle mathfrak p 250 ce romans c 57 ce one of the genuine pauline letters written to the romans as paul was about to leave asia minor and greece and expressing his hopes to continue his work in spain p displaystyle mathfrak p late 2nd century or 3rd century ce 1 corinthians c 56 ce another of the genuine pauline letters paul expresses his intention to revisit the church he founded in the city c 50 52 ce p displaystyle mathfrak p late 2nd century or 3rd century ce 2 corinthians 57 ce another of the genuine pauline letters it was written around the fall of 57 ce though its parts may have been separated by intervals of at least some months galatians c 55 ce paul does not express any wish to revisit the church in galatia which he founded and so some scholars believe the letter dates from the end of his missionary work the letter concerns the question of whether gentile converts are required to adopt full jewish customs it has also been dated to either 48 50 ce or 54 55 ce p displaystyle mathfrak p late 2nd century or 3rd century ce ephesians c 80 90 ce the letter appears to have been written after paul s death in rome by an author who uses his name p displaystyle mathfrak p late 2nd century or 3rd century ce philippians c 54 55 ce a genuine pauline letter it mentions caesar s household leading some scholars to believe that it is written from rome but some of the news in it could not have come from rome it seems rather to date from an earlier imprisonment perhaps in ephesus from which paul hopes to be released p displaystyle mathfrak p late 2nd century or 3rd century ce colossians c 62 70 ce some scholars believe colossians dates from paul s imprisonment in ephesus around 55 ce but differences in the theology suggest that it comes from much later in his career around the time of his imprisonment in rome p displaystyle mathfrak p late 2nd century or 3rd century ce 1 thessalonians c 51 ce one of the earliest of the genuine pauline epistles p displaystyle mathfrak p late 2nd century or 3rd century ce 2 thessalonians c 51 ce or post70 ce if this is a genuine pauline epistle it follows closely on 1 thessalonians but some of the language and theology point to a much later date from an unknown author using paul s name p displaystyle mathfrak p 300 ce 1 timothy 2 timothy epistle to titus c 100 ce the two timothy epistles and titus reflect a much more developed church organisation than that reflected in the genuine pauline epistles codex sinaiticus 350 ce p displaystyle mathfrak p 200 ce philemon c 54 55 ce a genuine pauline epistle written from an imprisonment probably in ephesus that paul expects will soon be over it has also been dated to perhaps 61 63 ad p displaystyle mathfrak p 3rd century ce hebrews c 80 90 ce the elegance of the greek and the sophistication of the theology do not fit the genuine pauline epistles but the mention of timothy in the conclusion led to its being included with the pauline group from an early date p displaystyle mathfrak p late 2nd century or 3rd century ce james c 65 85 ce like hebrews james is not so much a letter as an exhortation the style of the greek makes it unlikely that it was actually written by james the brother of jesus p displaystyle mathfrak p p displaystyle mathfrak p early 3rd century ce first peter c 75 90 ce p displaystyle mathfrak p 3rd 4th century ce second peter c 110 ce this is apparently the latest writing in the new testament quoting from jude assuming a knowledge of the pauline letters and including a reference to the gospel story of the transfiguration of christ p displaystyle mathfrak p 3rd 4th century ce epistles of john 90 110 ce the letters give no clear indication but scholars tend to place them about a decade after the gospel of john p displaystyle mathfrak p uncial 0232 codex sinaiticus 3rd 4th century ce jude uncertain the references to brother of james and to what the apostles of our lord jesus christ foretold suggest that it was written after the apostolic letters were in circulation but before 2 peter which uses it p displaystyle mathfrak p 3rd 4th century ce revelation c 95 ce the date is suggested by clues in the visions pointing to the reign of the emperor domitian p displaystyle mathfrak p 150 200 ce see also edit

champion in single combat forcing triopas and thessaly to join agamemnon s loose alliance of all the greek kingdoms meanwhile prince hector of troy and his younger brother paris negotiate a peace treaty with menelaus king of sparta however paris is having an affair with menelaus wife queen helen and smuggles her aboard their home bound vessel upon learning of this menelaus meets with agamemnon his elder brother and asks him to help take troy agamemnon agrees as conquering troy will give him control of the aegean sea agamemnon has odysseus king of ithaca persuade achilles to join them achilles who strongly dislikes agamemnon eventually decides to go after his mother thetis tells him that though he will die he will be forever glorified in troy king priam is dismayed when hector and paris introduce helen but welcomes her and decides to prepare for war the greeks eventually invade and take the trojan beach thanks largely to achilles and his myrmidons achilles has the temple of apollo sacked and claims briseis a priestess and the cousin of paris and hector as a prisoner he is angered when agamemnon spitefully takes her from him and decides that he will not aid agamemnon in the siege the trojan and greek armies meet outside the walls of troy during a parley paris offers to duel menelaus personally for helen s hand in exchange for the city being spared agamemnon intending to take the city regardless of the outcome accepts menelaus wounds paris and almost kills him but is himself killed by hector in the ensuing battle hector kills ajax and many greek soldiers fall to the trojan defenses on odysseus insistence agamemnon gives the order to fall back he gives briseis to the greek soldiers for their amusement but achilles saves her later that night briseis sneaks into achilles quarters to kill him instead she falls for him and they become lovers achilles then resolves to leave troy much to the dismay of patroclus his cousin and prot\u00e9g\u00e9 despite hector s objections priam orders him to retake the trojan beach and force the greeks home the attack unifies the greeks and the myrmidons enter the battle hector duels a man he believes to be achilles and cuts his throat only to discover it was actually patroclus distraught hector euthanizes patroclus and the armies agree to stop fighting for the day achilles is informed of his cousin s death and vows revenge wary of achilles hector shows his wife andromache a secret tunnel beneath troy should he die and the city fall he instructs her to take their child and any survivors out of the city to mount ida the next day achilles arrives outside troy and challenges hector the two duel until hector is killed and achilles drags his corpse back to the trojan beach priam in disguise sneaks into the camp and implores achilles to return hector s body for a proper funeral ashamed of his actions achilles agrees and allows briseis to return to troy with priam promising a twelve day truce so that hector s funeral rites may be held in peace he also orders his men to return home without him agamemnon declares that he will take troy regardless of the cost concerned odysseus concocts a plan to infiltrate the city he has the greeks build a gigantic wooden horse as a peace offering and abandon the trojan beach hiding their ships in a nearby cove priam orders the horse be brought into the city that night greeks hiding inside the horse emerge and open the city gates for the greek army commencing the sack of troy while andromache and helen guide the trojans to safety through the tunnel paris gives the sword of troy to aeneas instructing him to protect the trojans and find them a new home agamemnon kills priam and captures briseis who then kills agamemnon achilles fights his way through the city and reunites with briseis paris seeking to avenge his brother shoots an arrow through achilles heel and then several into his body achilles bids farewell to briseis and watches her flee with paris before

lucas mexico film production was disrupted for a period after hurricane marty affected filming areas the role of briseis was initially offered to bollywood superstar aishwarya rai but she refused it because she was not comfortable doing the lovemaking scenes that were included the role eventually went to rose byrne music edit main article troy music from the motion picture composer gabriel yared originally worked on the score for troy for over a year having been hired by the director wolfgang petersen tanja carovska provided vocals on various portions of the music as she later would on composer james horner s version of the soundtrack however the reactions at test screenings which used an incomplete version of the score were negative and in less than a day yared was off the project without a chance to fix or change his music james horner composed a replacement score in about four weeks he used carovska s vocals again and also included traditional eastern mediterranean music and brass instruments horner also collaborated with american singer songwriter josh groban and lyricist cynthia weil to write an original song for the film s end credits the product of this collaboration remember was performed by groban with additional vocals by carovska the soundtrack for the film was released on may 11 2004 through reprise records director s cut edit troy director s cut was screened at the 57th berlin international film festival on february 17 2007 and received a limited release in germany in april 2007 warner home video reportedly spent more than 1 million for the director s cut which includes at least 1000 new cuts or almost 30 minutes extra footage with a new running time of 196 minutes the dvd was released on september 18 2007 in the us the score of the film was changed dramatically with many of the female vocals being cut an addition to the music is the use of danny elfman s theme for planet of the apes during the pivotal fight between hector and achilles in front of the gates of troy various shots were recut and extended for instance the love scene between helen and paris was reframed to include more nudity of diane kruger the love scene between achilles and briseis is also extended only one scene was removed the scene where helen tends to the wound of paris is taken out the battle scenes were also extended showing much more of ajax s bloody rampage on the trojans during the initial attack by the greek army perhaps most significant was the sacking of troy barely present in the theatrical cut but shown fully here depicting the soldiers raping women and murdering babies characters were given more time to develop specifically priam and odysseus the latter being given a humorous introduction scene lastly bookend scenes were added the beginning being a soldier s dog finding its dead master and the end including a sequence where the few surviving trojans escape to mount ida in one of the commentary sequences the film s writer david benioff said that when it came to deciding whether to follow the iliad or to do what was best for the film they always decided with what was best for the film home media edit troy was released on dvd on

{"text_id": "4004", "text": "document: event computing wikipedia event computing jump to navigation search keystroke redirects here for multikey combinations see keyboard shortcut in computing an event is an action or occurrence recognized by software often originating asynchronously from the external environment that may be handled by the software computer events can be generated or triggered by the system by the user or in other ways typically events are handled synchronously with the program flow that is the software may have one or more dedicated places where events are handled frequently an event loop a source of events includes the user who may interact with the software by way of for example keystrokes on the keyboard another source is a hardware device such as a timer software can also trigger its own set of events into the event loop eg to communicate the completion of a task software that changes its behavior in response to events is said to be event driven often with the goal of being interactive contents hide 1 description 2 delegate event model 3 event handler 4 event notification 5 user generated events 51 mouse events 52 keyboard events 53 joystick events 54 touchscreen events 55 device events 6 see also 7 references 8 external links description edit event driven systems are typically used when there is some asynchronous external activity that needs to be handled by a program for example a user who presses a button on his mouse an event driven system typically runs an event loop that keeps waiting for such activities eg input from devices or internal alarms when one of these occurs it collects data about the event and dispatches the event to the event handler software that will deal with it a program can choose to ignore events and there may be libraries to dispatch an event to multiple handlers that may be programmed to listen for a particular event the data associated with an event at a minimum specifies what type of event it is but may include other information such as when it occurred who or what caused it to occur and extra data provided by the event source to the handler about how the event should be processed events are typically used in user interfaces where actions in the outside world mouse clicks window resizing keyboard presses messages from other programs etc are handled by the program as a series of events programs written for many windowing environments consist predominantly of event handlers events can also be used at instruction set level where they complement interrupts compared to interrupts events are normally handled synchronously the program explicitly waits for an event to be serviced typically by calling an instruction that dispatches the next event whereas an interrupt can demand service at any time delegate event model edit delegate event model clickme is the event source a button in this example and it contains a list of listeners a common variant in object oriented programming is the delegate event model which is provided by some graphic user interfaces this model is based on three entities a control which is the event source listeners also called event handlers that receive the event notification from the source interfaces in the broader meaning of the term that describe the protocol by which the event is to be communicated furthermore the model requires that every listener must implement the interface for the event it wants to listen to every listener must register with the source to declare its desire to listen to the event every time the source generates the event it communicates it to the registered listeners following the protocol of the interface c uses events as special delegates that can only be fired by the class that declares it this allows for better abstraction for example delegate void notifier string sender class model public event notifier notifyviews public void change notifyviews model class view1 public view1 model m m notifyviews new notifier this update1 void update1 string sender console writeline sender was changed during update class view2 public view2 model m m notifyviews new notifier this update2 void update2 string sender console writeline sender was changed class test static void main model model new model new view1 model new view2 model model change event handler edit further information event driven programming \u00a7 event handlers in computer programming an event handler is a callback subroutine that handles inputs received in a program called a listener in java and javascript each event is a piece of application level information from the underlying framework typically the gui toolkit gui events include key presses mouse movement action selections and timers expiring on a lower level events can represent availability of new data for reading a file or network stream event handlers are a central concept in event driven programming the events are created by the framework based on interpreting lower level inputs which may be lower level events themselves for example mouse movements and clicks are interpreted as menu selections the events initially originate from actions on the operating system level such as interrupts generated by hardware devices software interrupt instructions or state changes in polling on this level interrupt handlers and signal handlers correspond to event handlers created events are first processed by an event dispatcher within the framework it typically manages the associations between events and event handlers and may queue event handlers or events for later processing event dispatchers may call event handlers directly or wait for events to be dequeued with information about the handler to be executed event notification edit this section does not cite any sources please help improve this section by adding citations to reliable sources unsourced material may be challenged and removed june 2007 learn how and when to remove this template message event notification is a term used in conjunction with communications software for linking applications that generate small messages the events to applications that monitor the associated conditions and may take actions triggered by events event notification is an important feature in modern database systems used to inform applications when conditions they are watching for have occurred modern operating systems used to inform applications when they should take some action such as refreshing a window and modern distributed systems where the producer of an event might be on a different machine than the consumer or consumers event notification platforms are normally designed so that the application producing events does not need to know which applications will consume them or even how many applications will monitor the event stream it is sometimes used as a synonym for publish subscribe a term that relates to one class of products supporting event notification in networked settings the virtual synchrony model is sometimes used to endow event notification systems and publish subscribe systems with stronger fault tolerance and consistency guarantees user generated events edit there are a large number of situations or events that a program or system may generate or respond to some common user generated events include mouse events edit a pointing device can generate a number of software recognisable pointing device gestures a mouse can generate a number of mouse events such as mouse move including direction of move and distance mouse left right button up down and mouse wheel motion or a combination of these gestures keyboard events edit pressing a key on a keyboard or a combination of keys generates a keyboard event enabling the program currently running to respond to the introduced data such as which key s the user pressed joystick events edit moving a joystick generates an xy analogue signal they often have multiple buttons to trigger events some gamepads for popular game boxes use joysticks touchscreen events edit the events generated using a touchscreen are commonly referred to as touch events or gestures device events

requires the president of the united states to nominate supreme court justices and with senate confirmation requires justices to be appointed this was for the division of power between the president and senate by the founders who wrote he shall nominate and by and with the advice and consent of the senate shall appoint judges of the supreme court upon the election of a new president incoming white house staff prepare profiles of possible candidates for the supreme court considering not only judges but also politicians and other individuals whom they consider appropriate for the role besides considering national figures whose views are well known they consider others who are less recognized they go through published rulings articles speeches and other background material to get an idea of candidates values and views on constitutional issues age health race gender and likelihood of confirmation are also factored into considerations once a supreme court vacancy opens the president discusses the candidates with advisors senators also call the president with suggestions after a first choice is decided the candidate is contacted and called on by the president to serve on the highest court staffers send a vetting form for the candidate to fill out they visit the candidate to go over tax records and payments to domestic help candidates whom the president has never met are interviewed by white house officials before being sent to the white house to be interviewed in person by the president after making a final decision the president calls the candidate who is told to prepare a statement for an appearance in front of the national press for the president s formal announcement most presidents nominate individuals who broadly share their ideological views in many cases however a justice s decisions may be contrary to what the nominating president anticipated a famous instance was chief justice earl warren president dwight d eisenhower expected him to be a conservative judge but his decisions are arguably among the most liberal in the court s history eisenhower later called the appointment the biggest damn fool mistake i ever made another justice whose decisions ran contrary to what was believed to be his ideology was david souter who was nominated to the high court in 1990 by president george hw bush many pundits and politicians at the time expected souter to be a conservative however after becoming a justice his opinions generally fell on the liberal side of the political spectrum because the constitution does not set any qualifications for service as a justice the president may nominate any individual to serve on the court however that person must receive the confirmation of the senate confirmation edit in modern times the confirmation process has attracted considerable attention from special interest groups many of which lobby senators to confirm or to reject a nominee depending on whether the nominee s track record aligns with the group s views the senate judiciary committee conducts hearings questioning nominees to determine their suitability by convention nominees avoid revealing too much about their views on potential cases that may come before the court at the close of confirmation hearings the committee votes on whether the nomination should go to the full senate with a positive negative or neutral report the roberts court april 2017 present front row left to right ruth bader ginsburg anthony kennedy john roberts chief justice clarence thomas and stephen breyer back row left to right elena kagan samuel a alito sonia sotomayor and neil gorsuch the committee s practice of personally interviewing nominees is relatively recent beginning with harlan fiske stone in 1925 some western senators were concerned with his links to wall street and expressed their opposition when stone was nominated stone proposed what was then the novelty of appearing before the judiciary committee to answer questions his testimony helped secure a confirmation vote with very little opposition the second nominee to appear before the committee was felix frankfurter who only addressed at the committee s request what he considered to be slanderous allegations against him the modern practice of the committee questioning nominees on their judicial views began with the nomination of john marshall harlan ii in 1955 the nomination came shortly after the court handed down the landmark brown v board of education decision and several southern senators attempted to block harlan s confirmation hence the decision to testify once the committee reports out the nomination the whole senate considers it a simple majority vote is required to confirm or to reject a nominee prior to 2017 a successful filibuster threat could add the requirement of a supermajority of 60 needed in favor of cloture which would allow debate to end and force a final vote on confirmation rejections are relatively uncommon the senate has explicitly rejected twelve supreme court nominees in its history the most recent rejection of a nominee by vote of the full senate came in 1987 when the senate refused to confirm robert bork not everyone nominated by the president has received a floor vote in the senate prior to 2017 a nominee could be filibustered once debate on the nomination had begun in the full senate a filibuster indefinitely prolongs the debate preventing a final vote on the nominee president lyndon johnson s nomination of sitting associate justice abe fortas to succeed earl warren as chief justice in 1968 was the first successful filibuster of a supreme court nominee it included both republican and democratic senators concerned with fortas s ethics president donald trump s nomination of neil gorsuch to the seat vacated by antonin scalia was the second unlike the fortas filibuster however only democratic senators voted against cloture on the gorsuch nomination citing his perceived conservative judicial philosophy and the republican majority s prior refusal to take up obama s nomination of merrick garland to fill the vacancy this led the republican majority to change the rules and eliminate the filibuster for supreme court nominations not every supreme court nominee has received a floor vote in the senate a president may withdraw a nomination before an actual confirmation vote occurs typically because it is clear that the senate will reject the nominee this occurred most recently with the nomination of harriet miers in 2006 before committee hearings had begun citing concerns about senate requests during her confirmation process for access to internal executive branch documents resulting from her position as white house counsel in 1987 president ronald reagan withdrew the nomination of douglas h ginsburg because of news reports containing marijuana use allegations the senate may also fail to act on the nomination which expires at the end of the session for example president dwight eisenhower s first nomination of john marshall harlan ii in november 1954 was not acted on by the senate eisenhower renominated harlan in january 1955 and harlan was confirmed two months later most recently the senate failed to act on president barack obama s nomination of merrick garland in march 2016 to fill the vacancy left by the death of antonin scalia the nomination expired in january 2017 and the vacancy was later filled by president trump s appointment of neil gorsuch before 1981 the approval process of justices was usually rapid from the truman through nixon administrations justices were typically approved within one month from the reagan administration to the present however the process has taken much longer according to the congressional research service the average number of days from nomination to final senate vote since 1975 is 67 days 22 months while the median is 71 days or 23 months some believe this is because congress sees justices as playing a more political role than in the past the perceived politicization of the process has drawn criticism for example columnist george f will termed the defeat of robert bork s nomination unjust and more generally that the nomination process does not delve deeply into the nominee s jurisprudential thinking supreme court nominations have caused media speculation about whether the judge leans to the left middle or right one indication of the politicized selection process is how much time each nominee spends being questioned under the glare of media coverage before 1925 nominees were never questioned after 1955 every nominee has been required to appear before the senate judiciary committee and answer questions and the hours spent being grilled have lengthened from single digits before 1980 to double digits today another example of the politicization of the process was the merrick garland supreme court nomination which remained before the senate far longer than any other nominee

a resolution of confirmation and transmits it to the white house the president then prepares and signs a commission and causes the seal of the united states department of justice to be affixed to the document before the new justice can take office the date of commission determines a justice s seniority a ceremony is held in which the justice must take the constitutional oath which is used for every federal and state officeholder below the president and the judicial oath used for federal judges before entering into the execution of their office recess appointments edit potter stewart appointed by president dwight eisenhower was the last supreme court justice initially placed on the court through a recess appointment article ii section 2 of the us constitution provides that the president shall have power to fill up all vacancies that may happen during the recess of the senate by granting commissions which shall expire at the end of their next session thus when the senate is in recess the president may make a temporary appointment to any office requiring senate approval including filling vacancies on the supreme court without the senate s advice and consent such a recess appointee to the supreme court holds office only until the end of the next senate session always less than two years to continue to serve thereafter and be compensated for his or her service the nominee must be formally nominated by the president and confirmed by the senate of the ten justices who have received recess appointments two chief justices and eight associate justices only chief justice john rutledge was not subsequently confirmed for a regular appointment no president since dwight eisenhower who made three such appointments has made a recess appointment to the supreme court and the practice has become highly controversial even when applied to lower federal courts during the 110th congress the democratic leadership of the senate specifically blocked republican president george w bush from making any recess appointments with the use of pro forma sessions in 1960 the senate passed a resolution stating that it was the sense of the senate that recess appointments to the supreme court should not be made except under unusual circumstances being a resolution it has no legally binding effect but was intended as an expression of the position of the senate and as a guide to executive actions the resolution passed by a vote of 48 to 37 mainly along party lines following is a list of recess appointments that have been made to the supreme court justice appointed by date

17 1959 000000001959 12 05 0000 december 5 1959 confirmed tenure and vacancies edit the ability of a president to appoint new justices depends on the occurrence of a vacancy on the court the constitution provides that justices shall hold their offices during good behavior unless appointed during a senate recess the term good behavior is well understood to mean justices may serve for the remainder of their lives although they can voluntarily resign or retire a justice can also be removed by congressional impeachment and conviction however only one justice has been impeached by the house samuel chase in 1805 and he was acquitted in the senate moves to impeach sitting justices have occurred more recently for example william o douglas was the subject of hearings twice once in 1953 and again in 1970 but they have not reached a vote in the house no mechanism presently exists for removing a justice who is permanently incapacitated by illness or injury both unable to resign and unable to resume service because justices have indefinite tenure it is impossible to know when a vacancy will next occur sometimes vacancies arise in quick succession as in the early 1970s when lewis franklin powell jr and william h rehnquist were nominated to replace hugo black and john marshall harlan ii who retired within a week of each other sometimes a great length of time passes between nominations such as the eleven years between stephen breyer s nomination in 1994 and the departures of chief justice rehnquist and justice sandra day oconnor by death and retirement respectively in 2005 and 2006 it is also theoretically possible for congress to create additional vacancies by expanding the court itself the united states constitution does not specify the size of the supreme court but in article iii it authorizes the congress to fix the number of justices the judiciary act of 1789 called for the appointment of six justices as the country grew geographically congress increased the number of justices to correspond with the growing number of judicial circuits in 1807 the court was expanded to seven members allowing thomas jefferson to appoint thomas todd as a new justice the expansion to nine members in 1837 allowed andrew jackson to appoint john catron and martin van buren to appoint john mckinley and the addition of a tenth seat in 1863 allowed abraham lincoln to name stephen johnson field to the court however at the request of chief justice salmon p chase congress passed the judicial circuits act 1866 which provided that the next three justices to retire would not be replaced thus the size of the court should have eventually reached seven by attrition consequently one seat was removed in 1866 and a second in 1867 however this law did not play out to completion for in the judiciary act of 1869 also known as the circuit judges act the number of justices was again set at nine where it has since remained the new seat created in 1869 was filled the following year by ulysses s grant s appointment of joseph p bradley the last justice to be appointed to a newly created seat on the court president franklin d roosevelt attempted to expand the court in 1937 seeking to appoint an additional justice for each incumbent justice who reached the age of 70 years 6 months and refused retirement under roosevelt s proposal such appointments would continue until the court reached a maximum size of 15 justices ostensibly the proposal was made to ease the burdens of the docket on the elderly judges but the president s actual purpose was to pack the court with justices who would support new deal policies and legislation this plan usually called the court packing plan failed in congress and proved a political disaster for roosevelt the balance of the court shifted with the retirement of willis van devanter and the confirmation of hugo black in august 1937 by the end of 1941 roosevelt had appointed seven supreme court justices and elevated harlan fiske stone to chief justice despite the variability nearly all presidents so far have been able to appoint at least one justice the four exceptions are william henry harrison zachary taylor andrew johnson and jimmy carter harrison died a month after taking office though his successor john tyler made an appointment during that presidential term taylor likewise died early in his presidential term although his successor millard fillmore also made a supreme court nomination before the end of that term johnson was denied the opportunity to appoint a justice by a contraction in the size of the supreme court which congress may dictate jimmy carter is the only president who completed at least one full term in office without making a nomination to the court during his presidency references

an aggressive bad tempered hot dog vendor who appears early in the film when oliver and dodger steal his hot dogs he is described by dodger as a well known enemy of the four legged world meaning that he hates both cats and dogs production after the release of the black cauldron in 1985 michael eisner and jeffrey katzenberg invited the animators to pitch potential ideas for upcoming animated features infamously called the gong show after ron clements and john musker suggested the little mermaid and treasure island in space animator pete young suggested oliver twist with dogs originally intending to produce a live action adaptation of the musical oliver at paramount pictures katzenberg approved the pitch under the working title of oliver and the dodger the film was originally much darker and grittier with the film opening with sykes s two dobermans murdering oliver s parents setting the story to focus on oliver exacting his revenge as detailed in a draft dated on march 30 1987 george scribner and richard rich were announced as the directors of the project while pete young was appointed as story supervisor though rich left about six months into production leaving scribner as the sole director in this adaptation scribner turned oliver into a na\u00efve kitten dodger and the gang into dogs and fagin into a human and encouraged the film to be more street smart furthermore scribner borrowed a technique from lady and the tramp by blocking out the scenes on real streets and then photographing them with cameras mounted eighteen inches off the ground in this way the animators would use the photos as templates to provide a real dog s eye view of the action as work continued on oliver roy e disney came up with an idea that fagin would attempt to steal a rare panda from the city zoo however the writers would have problems with the idea and the panda subplot was eventually dropped when scribner suggested to have fagin hold oliver for ransom because he was a valuable rare asian cat for the film disney invested 15 million into a long term computer system called computer animation production system otherwise known as caps unlike the black cauldron and the great mouse detective which used computer imagery for special sequences eleven minutes of oliver company were computer generated such as the skyscrapers the taxi cabs trains fagin s scooter cart and the climactic subway chase meanwhile the traditional animation was handled by the next generation of disney animators including supervising animators glen keane ruben a aquino mike gabriel hendel butoy and mark henn as the nine old men had retired in the early 1980s throughout two and a half years of production six supervising animators and a team of over 300 artists and technicians worked on the film skidmore owings merrill was the database for the new york city skyline which was recreated accurately for the movie casting because personalities are considered the greatest strength of disney animated films the filmmakers sought believable voices to match the movement of the animation for this film the filmmakers cast fellow new york natives including bette midler for georgette sheryl lee ralph for rita and roscoe lee browne for francis comedian cheech marin was cast as the chihuahua tito because energy proved to be the key to tito s personality marin claimed i was encouraged to ad lib but i d say i just gave about 75 of the lines as they were written the natural energy of a chihuahua played right into that feeling george scribner was very encouraging as a director he kept the energy level high at the recording sessions pop singer billy joel was recommended for the voice of dodger by scribner because of his new york street smart savoir faire attitude and auditioned for the role by telephone after being given dialogue additionally joel confirmed he did the role because it was a disney movie and admitted that i had just had a little girl it s a great way to do something that my little girl could see that she could relate to right away music oliver company cd cover for the 1996 rerelease of the oliver company soundtrack an alternative cover was used in the united kingdom soundtrack album by various artists released genre pop rock blues rock label walt disney the soundtrack of oliver company contains an instrumental score by jac redford under the supervision of carole childs while jeffrey katzenberg had the idea to bring in big name singer songwriters each of whom would contribute a song into the film including billy joel barry manilow and huey lewis at his suggestion of his friend david geffen katzenberg brought in lyricist howard ashman who composed the song once upon a time in new york city musical composer jac redford was brought to compose the score who had a working relationship with disney music executive chris montan on the series st elsewhere ashman who with alan menken would write the songs for the next three disney films billy joel in addition to voicing dodger performed the character s song in the film the track list below represents the 1996 rerelease of the oliver company soundtrack the original 1988

more than 30 company logos and brand names were shown in the film including kodak dr scholls sony diet coke tab mcdonald s yamaha ryder and usa today however the filmmakers commented on abc s the wonderful world of disney that this was for realism was not paid product placement and that it would not be new york city without advertising instead katzenberg urged the marketing campaign to focus on the classic dickens novel and the pop score and promotional tie ins included sears which produced and manufactured products with themes inspired from the film and mcdonald s which sold christmas musical ornaments based on oliver and dodger and small finger puppets based on the characters in a happy meal for its theatrical rerelease in 1996 the film was accompanied with a promotional campaign by burger king in the united kingdom oliver company was not distributed by buena vista international but by warner bros buena vista international did however release the film on home video home media despite its financial success at the box office oliver company was not released on home video despite being one of the most requested disney films after its theatrical rerelease oliver company was released on vhs in the us on september 25 1996 for a limited time and in the uk in 1997 it was later released on dvd on may 14 2002 a 20th anniversary edition dvd was released on february 3 2009 and a 25th anniversary edition blu ray was released on august 6 2013 reception box office opening on the same weekend as don bluth s the land before time which debuted at number one grossing 75 million beating out oliver company which opened at fourth grossing 4 million nevertheless oliver company out grossed the land before time with domestic gross estimates of 53 million compared to 46 million of the latter its success prompted disney s senior vicepresident of animation peter schneider to announce the company s plans to release animated features annually on march 29 1996 disney rereleased the film in direct competition with all dogs go to heaven 2 grossing 45 million in its opening weekend in its total box office lifetime oliver company made a total domestic gross of 74 million at the us box office critical reception despite its success at the box office oliver company was met with mixed reviews from critics rotten tomatoes reported that 44 of critics gave the film positive reviews based on 36 reviews with an average rating of 54 10 its consensus states that oliver company is a decidedly lesser effort in the disney canon with lackluster songs stiff animation and a thoroughly predictable plot on the television program siskel ebert gene siskel gave the film a thumbs down siskel stated when you measure this film to the company s legacy of classics it does nt match up as he complained the story is too fragmented because oliver s story gets too sidetracked from the story in the film that gets convoluted too calculated for the bette midler billy joel crowd as well as little kids roger ebert gave the film a marginal thumbs up as he described the film as harmless inoffensive animation historian charles solomon wrote a favorable reviewing concluding that the film offers virtually ideal family holiday fare the cartoon action will delight young children while older ones who usually reject animation as kid stuff will enjoy the rock songs and hip characters especially the brash tito writing for people peter travers opined in his review too slight to rank with such disney groundbreakers as pinocchio and fantasia the film is more on the good fun level of the lady and the tramp and 101 dalmatians but why kick with its captivating characters sprightly songs and zap happy animation oliver company adds up to a tip top frolic desson howe of the washington post noted that the film retrieves some of the old disney charm with tail wagging energy and five catchy songs likewise fellow washington post film critic rita kempley praised the songs and animation and called it happy adaptation of the victorian classic barry walters reviewing for the san francisco examiner panned the film as a rather shabby transitional work one that lacks the sophistication of today s toons and does nt hold up to the disney classics of yesteryear the staff of halliwell s film guide called oliver company episodic and short on charm only now and then they added it provides glimpses of stylish animation the ren stimpy show creator john kricfalusi suggested that the film was derivative of ralph bakshi s works and jokingly suggested its use as a form of punishment likewise even some of the disney animators viewed the film unfavorably considering it another talking dog and cat movie accolades golden globe award for best original song for why should i worry nominated

who has cheated on her telling him that he should ve said no to the woman who has taken her place in his life you should ve said no you should ve gone home you should ve thought twice before you let it all go you should ve known that word bout what you did with her would get back to me swift wrote the song when she was sixteen years old she wrote the song because something really really dramatic and crazy was happening to her and she needed to address it in the form of music according to the country weekly magazine she was inspired to write it after she discovered that her boyfriend at the time had cheated on her the first line that came to her was the title and she wrote the chorus in five minutes swift has also said that many of the lyrics were based on actual words that she used when confronting her exboyfriend she compared the song to her previous single picture to burn while picture to burn has an angry and i m done with him attitude should ve said no is more of a moral statement it s an i love you we were awesome and great together but you messed this up and i would still be with you kinda thing you said yes and you should ve said no the song was a last minute

on my guitar and invisible as revenge songs and commented that swift s themes stayed the same throughout the concert country music blog engine 145 gave the song a thumbs down review reviewer matt c criticized the production as being too loud and thought that swift s vocals were overly reliant on pitch correction and not amenable to the song s concept live performances edit swift performed should

guardian and warned it s wise not to get too attached to anyone in the last kingdom charlotte runcie gave the opening episode 4 stars out of 5 in the daily telegraph wollaston and runcie both remarked on the similarities between last kingdom and game of thrones sean ogrady in the independent found that some of the language gave the series a satisfyingly earthy quality but he thought that the plot was a little convoluted the television reviewer for private eye was more critical arguing that the last kingdom demonstrates how game of thrones haunts the bbc and that the series was directly derivative of both fantasy series and european dramas such as the killing and wallander yet lacking the features that have made such series successful references edit jump up to bbc two announces new
